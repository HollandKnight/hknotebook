with any provision of this Agreement, the determination of whether a lease is
to be treated as an operating lease or capital lease shall be made without
giving effect to any change in accounting for leases pursuant to GAAP
resulting from the implementation of proposed Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) Leases (Topic 842) issued May 16, 2013, any oral, public deliberations
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board regarding such proposal, any
successor proposal, or any FASB deliberations regarding any such successor
proposal and (ii) if Holdings or the Parent Borrower notifies the
Administrative Agent that Holdings or the Parent Borrower requests an
amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change
occurring after the Closing Date in GAAP or in the application thereof on the
operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies Holdings
or the Parent Borrower that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any
provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is
given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then
such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and
applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such
notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance
herewith. It is understood that all financial computations hereunder with
respect to Holdings and the Subsidiaries (including computations of
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Net Tangible Assets) shall be made excluding
the accounts of all Excluded Subsidiaries.

  

(b)All pro forma computations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio required to
be made hereunder giving effect to any incurrence of Indebtedness, investment,
acquisition, disposition, Restricted Payment, payment in respect of
Indebtedness or other transaction shall be calculated after giving pro forma
effect thereto (and, in the case of any pro forma computations made hereunder
to determine whether any such transaction is permitted to be consummated
hereunder, to any incurrence of

  

49

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Indebtedness, investment, acquisition, disposition, Restricted Payment,
payment in respect of Indebtedness or other such transaction consummated since
the first day of the period covered by any component of such pro forma
computation and on or prior to the date of such computation) as if each such
transaction had occurred on the first day of the applicable Test Period, and,
to the extent applicable, to the historical earnings and cash flows associated
with the assets acquired or disposed of and any related incurrence or
reduction of Indebtedness, all in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X
under the Securities Act. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of
interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such
Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of
determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into
account any Swap Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness if such Swap
Agreement has a remaining term in excess of 12 months).

  

ARTICLE II

SECTION 2.01. Commitments.

  

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Revolving Lender
severally agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrowers from time to time
during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not
result in (i) such Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Revolving
Lender’s Revolving Commitment or (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Credit
Exposures exceeding the Revolving Credit Line Cap. Within the foregoing limits
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may
borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

  

(b)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term Lender
severally agrees to make its Term Loan to the Borrowers on the Closing Date in
a principal amount not to exceed the Term Commitment of such Term Lender.
Amounts repaid in respect of the Term Loan may not be reborrowed. Upon each
Term Lender’s making of its Term Loan, the Term Commitment of such Term Lender
shall be terminated.

  

SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings

  

(a)Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of
Revolving Loans made by the Revolving Lenders ratably in accordance with their
respective Revolving Commitments. The failure of any Revolving Lender to make
any Revolving Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other
Revolving Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Revolving
Commitments of the Revolving Lenders are several and no Revolving Lender shall
be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required. Each
Term Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Term Loans made
by the Term Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Term
Commitments. The failure of any Term Lender to make any Term Loan required to
be made by it shall not relieve any other Term Lender of its obligations
hereunder; provided that the Term Commitments of the Term Lenders are several
and no Term Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make
Loans as required.

  

(b)Subject to Section 2.13, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR
Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the applicable Borrower may request in accordance
herewith. Each Swingline Loan and Protective Advance shall be an ABR Loan.
Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic
or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that
any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the relevant
Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

50

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

(c)At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Borrowing,
such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is (a) in the case of a
Revolving Loan, an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and (b) in the case of a
Term Loan, $1,000,000 (unless no portion of the Term Loan constitutes an ABR
Loan) and not less than $10,000,000. At the time that each ABR Revolving
Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000; provided that
an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the
entire unused balance of the total Revolving Commitments or that is required
to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section
2.05(e). Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. Borrowings of more than
one Type and Class may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there
shall not at any time be more than a total of 12 Eurodollar Revolving
Borrowings outstanding and 5 Eurodollar Term Borrowings outstandings.

  

(d)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower shall be
entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the
Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the applicable
Scheduled Maturity Date without the consent of the applicable Lenders.

    

SECTION 2.03. Requests for Borrowings.

  

(a)To request a Revolving Borrowing, a Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (i) in the case of a

receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of
the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested
Borrowing.

(c)To request the Term Borrowings, a Borrower shall deliver to Term Agent and
Administrative Agent a written Borrowing Request in substantially the form of

SECTION 2.04. Swingline Loans; Protective Advances.

  

(a)Swingline Loans.

  

(i)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lenders
agree to make Swingline Loans to the Borrowers from time to time during the
Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding
that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Swingline Loans exceeding $100,000,000 or (ii) the sum of the total Revolving
Credit Exposures exceeding the Revolving Credit Line Cap; provided that no
Swingline Lender shall be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an
outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and
reborrow Swingline Loans.

  

(ii)To request a Swingline Loan, a Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent and the applicable Swingline Lender of such request by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy or electronic transmission), not later than 12:00 noon,
New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice
shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a
Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The applicable
Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the relevant
Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of such Borrower
with such Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to
finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section
2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.

  

(iii)Subject to Section 2.19, a Swingline Lender may by written notice given
to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on
any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on
such Business Day in all or a portion of such Swingline

  

52

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Lender’s Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate
amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate.
Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give
notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such
Lender’s Applicable Revolving Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Revolving
Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees,
upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of the applicable Swingline Lender, such Lender’s Applicable
Revolving Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Revolving Loans. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in
Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence
and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving
Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Lender shall
comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06
with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall
apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Swingline Lender the
amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the relevant Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan
acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of
such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the
applicable Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by a Swingline Lender from a
Borrower (or other party on behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline
Loan of such Borrower after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds
of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the
Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent
shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that
shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to such
Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such
payment so remitted shall be repaid to such Swingline Lender or to the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is
required to be refunded to such Borrower for any reason. The purchase of
participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not
relieve the relevant Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

  

(iv)The Parent Borrower may designate any Revolving Lender to be a Swingline
Lender hereunder subject to the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender. Any
such designation shall not be effective until confirmed in a written agreement
signed by the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the applicable
Revolving Lender.

  

(b)Protective Advances.

  

(i) Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding (but
subject to the limitations set forth below in this Section), the
Administrative Agent is authorized by the Borrowers and the Lenders, in its
sole discretion (but with absolutely no obligation), and whether or not the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied, to make
Revolving Loans to the Borrowers, on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, in
amounts that exceed Availability, which the Administrative Agent, in its
Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (A) to preserve or protect
the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (B) to enhance the likelihood of, or
maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and other Obligations, or (C)
to pay any other amount chargeable to or required to be paid by the Loan
Parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including payments of
reimbursable expenses (including costs, fees, and expenses as described in
Section 9.03) and other sums payable under the Loan Documents (any such Loans
are herein referred to collectively as “Protective Advances”), it being agreed
that no Protective Advance shall result in a Default due to the Borrowers’
failure to comply with Section 2.01 or Section 4.02 for so long as such
Protective Advance remains outstanding in accordance with the terms of this
Section, but solely with respect to the amount of such

  

53

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Protective Advance. Protective Advances shall be secured by the Liens in favor
of the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) in and to
the Collateral and shall constitute Obligations hereunder. All Protective
Advances shall be ABR Borrowings and shall mature on the earlier of the
Maturity Date, the date that is 30 days after the making of such Protective
Advance (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business
Day), or 3 Business Days following the demand for payment thereof by
Administrative Agent. The authority of the Administrative Agent to make
Protective Advances is limited to an aggregate amount not to exceed 5% of the
Revolving Maximum Credit at any time, and no Protective Advance shall cause
any Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure to exceed its Revolving Commitment,
provided that the Required Revolving Lenders may at any time revoke the
Administrative Agent’s authorization to make Protective Advances (it being
agreed that any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective
prospectively upon the Administrative Agent’s receipt thereof). At any time
that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied,
the Administrative Agent may request that the Revolving Lenders make a
Revolving Loan to repay a Protective Advance. At any other time the
Administrative Agent may require the Lenders to fund their risk participations
described in Section 2.04(b)(ii).

  

(ii)The Administrative Agent may, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, on any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire
participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Protective
Advances outstanding, specifying in such notice the aggregate amount of the
Protective Advances in which the Lenders will participate and specifying for
each Lender such Lender’s Applicable Revolving Percentage of such Protective
Advances. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees,
upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent
such Lender’s Applicable Revolving Percentage of such Protective Advances.
Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations in Protective Advances pursuant to this paragraph is absolute
and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be
made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each
Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.06 with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Lender (and Section
2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the
Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly apply the
amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders to its claims against
them in respect of such participations in Protective Advances. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the relevant Borrower of any participations
in any Protective Advances acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter
payments in respect of such Protective Advances shall be made to the
Administrative Agent for the accounts of the applicable Lenders. Any amounts
received by the Administrative Agent from a Borrower (or other party on behalf
of such Borrower) in respect of a Protective Advance of such Borrower after
receipt of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have
made their payments pursuant to this paragraph, as their interests may appear;
provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the
Administrative Agent if and to the extent such payment is required to be
refunded to such Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a
Protective Advance pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the relevant
Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

  

SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit.

  

(a)General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) any
Account Party may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own
account or for the account of any other Subsidiary or other direct or indirect
subsidiary of Holdings or the Parent Borrower (it being understood that the
applicable Account Party will remain liable hereunder for the obligations in
respect of which any Letter of Credit is issued for the account of any other
Subsidiary or subsidiary), in a form reasonably

  

54

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
during the Availability Period, and (ii) the Issuing Banks agree to issue
Letters of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of
letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by an Account Party
to, or entered into by an Account Party with, any Issuing Bank relating to any
Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

  

(b)Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions.

  

(i)To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or
extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), an Account Party shall hand
deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements
for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to the
applicable Issuing Bank (reasonably in advance of the requested date of
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of
a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed
or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of
Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section),
the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary
thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend,
renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing
Bank, such Account Party also shall submit a letter of credit application on
such Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter
of Credit.

  

(ii)A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if
(and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit
the applicable Account Party shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (A) the
LC Exposure shall not exceed $750,000,000, (B) the sum of the total Revolving
Credit Exposures shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Line Cap, and (C) after
giving effect thereto, the LC Exposure of any Issuing Bank shall not exceed
the amount for such Issuing Bank set forth on Schedule 2.05 except as
otherwise agreed by such Issuing Bank with the approval of Administrative
Agent and the Parent Borrower.

  

(iii)Each Issuing Bank shall provide to the LC Agent and the Administrative
Agent not later than 3:00 p.m. (or promptly thereafter, if unable to do so by
3:00 p.m.), New York City time, on the first Business Day of each calendar
week a report of such Issuing Bank setting forth (A) the aggregate amount of
all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank that are outstanding as of
3:00 p.m. on the last Business Day of the preceding calendar week, (B) the
average daily undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank for each calendar day during the period since the last calendar day
covered by the preceding weekly report (or, in the case of the first weekly
report, during the period from and including the Closing Date) and (C) the
aggregate amount of LC Disbursements made by such Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed as of the time of such report. In addition to providing such weekly
reports, each Issuing Bank shall, from time to time upon request of the LC
Agent or the Administrative Agent, provide the LC Agent and the Administrative
Agent with information of the type referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence on a more frequent basis.

  

(iv)The LC Agent shall provide to each Lender not later than 3:00 p.m. (or
promptly thereafter, if unable to do so by 3:00 p.m.), New York City time, on
the first Business Day of each calendar month a report setting forth the
aggregate amount of all Letters of Credit that are outstanding as of the date
of the most recent weekly reports delivered by the Issuing Banks to the
Administrative Agent and the LC Agent pursuant to the immediately preceding
paragraph.

  

55

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

(v)Neither the LC Agent nor the Administrative Agent nor any Issuing Bank
shall have any duty or obligation at any time to monitor the LC Exposure
relative to the total Commitments or the Borrowing Base and neither the LC
Agent nor the Administrative Agent nor any Issuing Bank shall have any
liability in respect of the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a
Letter of Credit to the extent that such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension results in the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the
Revolving Credit Line Cap. It shall be the responsibility of the Borrowers and
the Account Parties to ensure that, after giving effect to the issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, the sum of the total
Revolving Credit Exposures does not exceed the Revolving Credit Line Cap.

  

(c)Expiration Date. Except for Extended Letters of Credit issued in accordance
with Section 2.05(k), each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the
close of business on the date that is five Business Days prior to the
Scheduled Maturity Date.

  

(d)Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a
Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action
on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank in
respect of such Letter of Credit hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and
each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation
in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Revolving
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving
Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such
Revolving Lender’s Applicable Revolving Percentage of each LC Disbursement
made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Account Party
on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to an Account Party for any
reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction
or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall
be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

  

(e)Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect
of a Letter of Credit, (i) the applicable Account Party shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to such Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if such Account Party shall have received notice
of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date,
or, if such notice has not been received by such Account Party prior to such
time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (A)
the Business Day that such Account Party receives such notice, if such notice
is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or
(B) the Business Day immediately following the day that such Account Party
receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the
day of receipt; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than
$10,000,000, the Parent Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing
set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04(a) that such
payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing by the Parent Borrower or
a Swingline Loan to the Parent Borrower in an equivalent amount and, to the
extent so financed, such Account Party’s obligation to make such payment shall
be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or
Swingline Loan; or (ii) such Issuing Bank may, if arrangements to do so have
been agreed upon in writing by the Parent Borrower, a Borrowing Subsidiary or
an Account Party and such Issuing Bank, obtain reimbursement of such LC
Disbursement by debiting directly from an account of the Parent Borrower, such
Borrowing Subsidiary or such Account Party maintained with such Issuing Bank
(or one of its Affiliates) an amount equal to such LC Disbursement; provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to prevent the applicable Account
Party

  

  

56

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

from reimbursing LC Disbursements of an Issuing Bank in accordance with
alternate procedures agreed upon with such Issuing Bank, so long as such
reimbursements are made no later than required under clause (i) above. If such
Account Party fails to make such payment when due or the applicable Issuing
Bank is unable to debit the designated account of the Parent Borrower, the
relevant Borrowing Subsidiary or the relevant Account Party for the full
amount of the LC Disbursement, in each case as provided in the preceding
sentence, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the LC Agent (and upon
receipt of such notice the LC Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender and the
Administrative Agent) of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due
from such Account Party in respect thereof and (in the case of such notice
from the LC Agent to each Lender) such Lender’s Applicable Revolving
Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender
shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment
then due from such Account Party (the “Participation Amount”), in the same
manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Revolving Loans made by
such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay
to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of
any payment from such Account Party pursuant to this paragraph, the
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such
Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving
Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC
Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline
Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve
such Account Party of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

  

(f)Obligations Absolute. An Account Party’s obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever
and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter
of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft
or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or
circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that
might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Account Party’s
obligations hereunder. Neither the LC Agent, the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their respective Related Parties,
shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with
the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to
make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred
to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or
delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to
make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or
any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank;
provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the applicable
Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Account Party to the extent of
any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of
which are hereby waived by such Account Party to the extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by such Account Party that are caused by the
applicable Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether
drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the
terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the applicable
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) or
such other standard of care as shall be separately agreed to in writing by
such Issuing Bank and the applicable Account Party, such Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of
the foregoing and without limiting the

  

  

57

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the
terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole
discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of
such Letter of Credit.

  

(g)Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the LC Agent, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Account Party
by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or electronic transmission), or by such
other means of communication (if any) as have been agreed upon by such Account
Party and such Issuing Bank, of such demand for payment and whether such
Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve such
Account Party of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders
with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

  

(h)Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then,
unless the applicable Account Party shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement
is made to but excluding the date that such Account Party reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to an ABR Revolving Loan;
provided that, if such Account Party fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement
when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall
apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of
the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the
date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to
reimburse an Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the
extent of such payment.

  

(i)Designation and Replacement of Issuing Banks. Account Parties shall
designate each Revolving Lender (or an Affiliate of a Revolving Lender
identified by such Revolving Lender to Parent Borrower for such purpose) to be
an Issuing Bank hereunder and such Revolving Lender (or the Affiliate of such
Revolving Lender, as the case may be) upon such designation shall agree to
become an Issuing Bank, except that a Revolving Lender shall not be required
to be an Issuing Bank with the consent of Administrative Agent and Parent
Borrower; provided, that, Parent Borrower’s consent shall not be required in
the determination of which Lenders are Issuing Banks on the Closing Date. Such
Account Party shall notify the Administrative Agent of any such designation.
No Lender that is not an Issuing Bank on the Closing Date may thereafter
become an Issuing Bank without the consent of Administrative Agent, such
Lender and Parent Borrower. Upon a Revolving Lender becoming an Issuing Bank
after the date hereof, Schedule 2.05 shall be amended by Administrative Agent
(and no consent or approval of Lenders shall be required with respect to such
amendment) to adjust the sublimits for each Issuing Bank set forth on such
Schedule in such amounts as Parent Borrower, Administrative Agent and such
Issuing Bank may agree. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by
Administrative Agent with the approval of Parent Borrower or by Parent
Borrower with the approval of Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent may
amend Schedule 2.05 to reflect any such change permitted by this Section
2.05(i) (without the consent or approval of Lenders). The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the
time any such replacement shall become effective, the applicable Account Party
shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank
pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such
replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and
obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of
Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing
Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing
Bank, or to such successor and all

  

58

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of
an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party
hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing
Bank under this Agreement solely with respect to Letters of Credit issued by
it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional
Letters of Credit.

  

(j)Cash Collateralization. If (i) any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, (ii) the Administrative Agent has declared the Revolving Loans
outstanding hereunder due and payable pursuant to Section 7.01 or (iii) in the
case of a Defaulting Lender, there shall exist any LC Exposure that cannot be
reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.21(c) then,
on the Business Day that an Account Party receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Revolving Lenders demanding the deposit
of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, such Account Party shall
deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the
Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders (or, in the case of
clause (iii), the non-Defaulting Lenders), an amount in cash equal to the LC
Exposure (or, in the case of clause (iii), the LC Exposure of the Defaulting
Lender that cannot be fully reallocated pursuant to Section 2.21(c)(i)) as of
such date attributable to Letters of Credit issued for the account of such
Account Party plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the
obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately,
and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or
other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with
respect to Holdings, any Borrower or any Account Party described in clause (h)
or (i) of Section 7.01; provided further that, in the case of clause (iii), an
Account Party may, if approved by each applicable Issuing Bank in its sole
discretion, provide other credit support in lieu of the deposit of cash
collateral pursuant to this paragraph. Such deposit shall be held by the
Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the
obligations of such Account Party under this Agreement. The Administrative
Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right
of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the
investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and
request of an Account Party (and at such Account Party’s risk and expense),
subject to approval by the Administrative Agent, such deposits shall not bear
interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in
such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent to reimburse any Issuing Bank that is not a Defaulting Lender for LC
Disbursements in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of such
Account Party for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed and, to the
extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of such Account Party for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the
maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy the other
Obligations.

  

(k)Extended Letters of Credit. An Account Party may request that an Issuing
Bank allow, and an Issuing Bank may (in its sole discretion) agree to allow,
one or more Letters of Credit issued by it to expire later than the date that
is five Business Days prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date. Any such Letter of
Credit is referred to herein as an “Extended Letter of Credit”. The following
provisions shall apply to any Extended Letter of Credit, notwithstanding any
contrary provision set forth herein.

  

(i)The participations of each Revolving Lender in each Extended Letter of
Credit shall terminate at the close of business on the date that is five
Business Days prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date, with the effect that
Revolving Lenders shall not have any obligations to acquire participations in
any LC Disbursement made thereafter or otherwise with respect to such Extended
Letter of Credit, except with respect to demands for drawings submitted on or
prior to such date.

  

(ii)On or prior to the date that is fifteen days prior to the Scheduled
Maturity Date (or on the date of any earlier termination of the Commitments),
each Account Party shall deposit with each Issuing Bank an amount in cash (or
other credit support approved by such Issuing Bank in its

  

59

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

sole discretion) equal to the LC Exposure as of such date attributable to the
Extended Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the account of such
Account Party. Each such deposit shall be held by the applicable Issuing Bank
in an account maintained by it as collateral for the obligations of such
Account Party in respect of such Extended Letters of Credit. Each applicable
Issuing Bank shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the
exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest
earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at
the request of an Account Party (and at such Account Party’s risk and expense)
and subject to the agreement of the relevant Issuing Bank (not to be
unreasonably withheld), such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or
profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys
in such account shall be applied by the relevant Issuing Bank to reimburse LC
Disbursements in respect of such Extended Letters of Credit issued for the
account of such Account Party for which such Issuing Bank has not been
reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the
satisfaction of any reimbursement obligations of such Account Party for such
Issuing Bank’s LC Exposure at such time and, to the extent of any excess over
such Issuing Bank’s LC Exposure at such time, returned to the applicable
Account Party.

  

(iii)After the close of business on the date that is five Business Days prior
to the Scheduled Maturity Date, the fees that would have accrued pursuant to
clause (i) of Section 2.11(b) (if the participations of the Revolving Lenders
in the Extended Letters of Credit had not terminated) shall continue to accrue
on the LC Exposure in respect of each Extended Letter of Credit and shall be
payable to each applicable Issuing Bank for its own account.

  

SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings

  

(a)Each Revolving Lender shall make each Revolving Loan to be made by it
hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately
available funds by 12:00 pm, New York City time for any Revolving Loans to be
made on the Closing Date and for any Revolving Loans thereafter by 1:00 p.m.,
New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently
designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Revolving Lenders; provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04(a). The
Administrative Agent will make such Revolving Loans available to the
applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like
funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent
in New York City and designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing
Request or to such other account as may be designated in writing by Parent
Borrower to Administrative Agent prior to the Closing Date and as is
reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent; provided that ABR Revolving
Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in
Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the
applicable Issuing Bank; and provided further that Revolving Loans made to
finance the reimbursement of a Protective Advance shall be retained by the
Administrative Agent or, to the extent that the Revolving Lenders have made
payments pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(ii) to reimburse the Administrative Agent
in respect of any such Protective Advance, respectively, remitted by the
Administrative Agent to such Revolving Lenders as their interests may appear.

  

(b)Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing
(or, in respect of the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement under Section
2.05(e), such Revolving Lender’s Participation Amount), the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share (or such Revolving
Lender’s Participation Amount, as applicable) available on such date in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may (but shall not be
required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
applicable Borrower (or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable) a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its
share of the applicable Borrowing (or such Revolving Lender’s Participation
Amount, as applicable) available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower (or the

  

60

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable) severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made
available to such Borrower (or such Issuing Bank, as applicable) to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case
of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the greater of the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of
such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If (x) with respect
to such Borrowing, such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such
Borrowing or (y) with respect to such reimbursement of such LC Disbursement,
the applicable Account Party shall reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement
before the applicable Revolving Lender or Issuing Bank reimburses the
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, then the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to receive or retain the amount due to it as provided
above together with interest payable by such Account Party with respect to the
period commencing on the date that the Administrative Agent funded its payment
to the applicable Issuing Bank.

  

(c)Each Term Lender shall make the Term Loan to be made by it hereunder on the
Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 pm, New
York City time to the account of the Term Agent most recently designated by it
for such purpose by notice to the Term Lenders. The Term Agent will make such
Term Loans available to the Parent Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts
so received, in like funds, to an account of the Parent Borrower maintained
with the Term Agent designated by the Parent such Borrower in the applicable
Borrowing Request or to such other account as may be designated in writing by
Parent Borrower to Term Agent prior to the Closing Date and as is reasonably
satisfactory to Term Agent.

    

SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections.

  

(a)Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an
initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter,
the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different
Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing,
may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. Such
Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the
affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably
among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans
comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This
Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings or Protective Advances, which
may not be converted or continued.

(b)To make an election pursuant to this Section, the relevant Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent (or in the case of an election with respect to
Term Loans, the Term Agent) of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were
requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on
the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery,
telecopy or electronic transmission to the Administrative Agent (or in the
case of an election with respect to Term Loans, the Term Agent) of a written
Interest Election Request in substantially the form of Exhibit F hereto or
otherwise in a form reasonably approved by the Administrative Agent (or in the
case of an election with respect to Term Loans, the Term Agent) and, in each
case, signed by such Borrower.

  

(c)Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

  

61

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

  

(i)the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if
different options are being elected with respect to different portions
thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in
which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv)
below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

  

(ii)the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election
Request, which shall be a Business Day;

  

(iii)whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
Borrowing; and

  

(iv)if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period
to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be
a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period” and
which shall not extend beyond the Scheduled Maturity Date applicable to the
Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies at such time.

  

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.

(d)Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent (or in the case of an election with respect to Term
Loans, the Term Agent) shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of
such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.

  

(e)If the relevant Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof,
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative
Agent (or in the case of an election with respect to Term Loans, the Term
Agent), at the request of the Required Revolving Lenders as to Revolving Loans
and at the request of the Required Term Lenders as to Term Loans, so notifies
the Parent Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no
outstanding Revolving Borrowing or Term Loan Borrowing may be converted to or
continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar
Revolving Borrowing and Eurodollar Term Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

  

SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Revolving Commitments.



(a)Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on
the Maturity Date.

  

(b)The Parent Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce,
the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving
Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000
and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Parent Borrower shall not terminate
or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent
prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the
Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the Revolving Credit Line Cap.

  

(c)The Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and

  

62

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Revolving Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each notice delivered by the Parent Borrower pursuant to this Section
shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving
Commitments delivered by the Parent Borrower may state that such notice is
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other events,
in which case such notice may be revoked by the Parent Borrower (by notice to
the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments
shall be made ratably among the Revolving Lenders based on their Applicable
Revolving Percentage.

  

SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

  

(a)Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay:

  

(i)to the Revolving Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender the then
unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan owed by such Borrower to such
Lender on the Maturity Date;

  

(ii)to the Term Agent for the account of each Term Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Term Loan owed by such Borrower to such Lender on the
Maturity Date;

  

(iii) to each Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Swingline Loan owed to such Swingline Lender by such Borrower on the earlier
of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that
is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days
after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a new
Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans of
such Borrower then outstanding;

  

(iv)to the Revolving Agent the then unpaid principal amount of each Protective
Advance on the earliest of (A) the Maturity Date, (B) the day that is 30 days
after the making of such Protective Advance (or if such day is not a Business
Day, the next succeeding Business Day) and (C) 3 Business Days following
demand by the Administrative Agent;

  

(v)to the Term Agent for the account of each Term Lender, beginning on October
1, 2014, and on the first day of each calendar quarter thereafter, equal
consecutive quarterly installments of principal each in the amount of
$1,250,000.

  

(b)Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account
or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

  

(c)The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts (the “Loan Account”) in
which it shall record (i) the amount of each Revolving Loan made hereunder,
the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii)
the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and
payable from each Borrower to each Revolving Lender hereunder and (iii) the
amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the
account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof. The Term Agent shall
maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Term Loan
made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from each

  

63

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Borrower to each Term Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum
received by the Term Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender’s share thereof.

  

(d)To the extent not paid when due, Administrative Agent may, at its option
(but shall have no obligation to) advance any interest with respect to any ABR
Loan (but in no event, except as provided below, earlier than the fourth
Business Day after such due date), or any LIBOR Loan, or any scheduled fees
pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or (b)(but in no event, except as provided below,
for such scheduled fees earlier than the fourth Business Day after such due
date) to which any Agent or Lender is entitled from the Loan Parties and may
charge the same to the Loan Account in accordance with its customary practice
and shall advise Parent Borrower of any such advance or charge promptly after
the making thereof. Any amount which is added to the principal balance of the
Loan Account as provided in this Section shall bear interest at the interest
rate then and thereafter applicable to ABR Loans. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, at any time a Specified Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, Administrative Agent may at its option (but shall
have no obligation to) advance any such amounts provided for in this clause
(d) or any other amounts to which any Agent or Lender is entitled from the
Loan Parties and may charge the same to the Loan Account (which shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any such Specified Event of Default or any other
Event of Default). All amounts in respect of interest, fees or other amounts
payable by Loan Parties in respect of Revolving Credit Exposure shall be sent
by Federal funds wire transfer to the Revolving Agent Payment Account, except
as Administrative Agent may otherwise agree. All amounts in respect of
interest, fees or other amounts payable by Loan Parties in respect of the Term
Loans shall be sent by Federal funds wire transfer to the Term Agent Payment
Account, except as Term Agent may otherwise agree.

  

(e)The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b),(c)
or (d) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each Borrower to
repay its Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

(f)Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory
note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in
substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory
note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

  

(g)On each Business Day during any Cash Dominion Period, except to the extent
that during a continuing Event of Default the Administrative Agent elects, or
the Required Lenders direct, amounts to be applied as set forth in Section
2.17(h), the Administrative Agent shall apply all immediately available funds
credited to the Concentration Account, and the Administrative Agent may, in
its Permitted Discretion, apply other amounts contained in Control Accounts
or, subject to the terms of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or any other
applicable Intercreditor Agreement, any other amounts received by or on behalf
of Administrative Agent (except for (i) amounts permitted to be held as
Permitted Investments pursuant to Section 6.04(a) and (ii) proceeds of assets,
other than ABL Priority Collateral, which assets are subject to Liens
permitted under Section 6.02, to the extent such proceeds are required to be
applied to the payment of the applicable obligations secured thereby), in each
case, first to prepay any Protective Advances that may be outstanding, pro
rata, second to prepay any Swingline Loans that may be outstanding, third to
prepay any Revolving Loans that may be outstanding, it being understood that
any prepayments of Revolving Loans shall be applied in accordance with Section
2.17(h), fourth to cash collateralize outstanding LC Exposure in the manner
provided in Section 2.05(j) and fifth,

  

64

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

to prepay any Term Loans (including any Additional Term Loans, if any, except
to the extent such Additional Term Loans are to be paid after the other Term
Loans, in which case, sixth, to prepay any Additional Term Loans) that may be
outstanding. If the Borrowers are required to provide (and have provided the
required amount of) cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.09(g), the
amount of such cash collateral (to the extent not otherwise required to be
maintained by any other provision of this Agreement) shall be returned to the
Borrowers within two Business Days after the last day of such Cash Dominion
Period.

  

SECTION 2.10. Optional and Mandatory Prepayment of Revolving Loans and Term
Loans.



(a)Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to
prepay any of its Borrowings in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in
accordance with paragraph (f) of this Section.

  

(b)Each Borrower may, subject to the terms of this Section and subject to
prior notice in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section, except as
otherwise provided in Sections 2.09(g) or 2.17(h)(ii), prepay to Term Agent
for the account of Term Lenders the outstanding principal amount of the Term
Loans in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date
of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, that (i) each
partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 or
an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) in the event of
any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan, the applicable Borrower shall be
obligated to reimburse the Term Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.15.

  

(c)In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the Revolving Credit
Exposures exceeds the Revolving Credit Line Cap (other than to the extent that
Protective Advances permitted under Section 2.04 cause the sum of the
Revolving Credit Exposures to exceed the Borrowing Base), the Borrowers shall
prepay to Revolving Agent for the account of Revolving Lenders Borrowings (or,
if no such Borrowings are outstanding, each Account Party shall deposit cash
collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section
2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess or (if approved by each
applicable Issuing Bank in its sole discretion) provide other credit support
for the applicable LC Exposure.

  

(d)Borrowers will be required to prepay Term Loans to Term Agent for the
account of Term Lenders to the extent that Term Loans exceed the Borrowing
Base (without giving effect to the Term Loan Reserve for this purpose) then in
effect, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the
principal amount prepaid (provided, that in the event of any such prepayment
of a Eurodollar Loan, the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse
the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.15) after compliance with
Section 2.10(c).

  

(e)In the event that there shall be Consolidated Excess Cash Flow for any
fiscal year of Holdings and its Subsidiaries (commencing with the fiscal year
ending in January 2016), Borrowers shall, no later than 90 days after the end
of such fiscal year, prepay the Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to (i)
50% of such Consolidated Excess Cash Flow minus (ii) (a) any voluntary
repayments of the Term Loans made with Internally Generated Cash (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, repurchases of loans under the Existing Term Loan
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.6(i) of the Existing Term Loan Agreement as
in effect on the date hereof and repayment of loans under the Existing Term
Loan Agreement with the cash proceeds of any refinancing indebtedness) and (b)
any optional prepayments of term loans under the Existing Term Loan Agreement
(or mandatory prepayments of the Existing Term Loan Agreement required to be
made based on “Consolidated Excess Cash Flow” (as defined in the Existing Term
Loan Agreement) from such fiscal year); provided, that if, as of the last day
of the most

  

65

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

recently ended fiscal year of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, the Senior
Secured Leverage Ratio (determined for any such period by reference to the
calculation of the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such
fiscal year, delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(c)) shall be (A) equal to or
less than 3.50:1.00 and greater than 2.75:1.00, Borrowers shall only be
required to make the prepayments otherwise required by this Section 2.10(e) in
an amount equal to 25% of such Consolidated Excess Cash Flow minus (i) any
voluntary repayments of the Term Loans and (ii) any optional prepayments of
term loans under the Existing Term Loan Agreement (or mandatory prepayments of
the Existing Term Loan Agreement required to be made based on “Consolidated
Excess Cash Flow” (as defined in the Existing Term Loan Agreement) from such
fiscal year) and (B) equal to or less than 2.75:1.00, Borrower shall not be
required to make any prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.10(e).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no payments shall be required
under this Section 2.10(e) for any fiscal year to the extent that, on the 90th
day following the end of such fiscal year or on any earlier date Borrowers may
otherwise elect to make such payment, the sum of (1) Excess Availability and
(2) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents of the Loan Parties in
excess of the Operating Cash Threshold, after giving effect to such payment,
would be less than 27.5% of the Revolving Credit Line Cap; provided that such
payment shall be required to be made hereunder on the first day that, for the
immediately preceding 30 consecutive days, the sum of (x) Excess Availability
and (y) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents of the Loan Parties
in excess of the Operating Cash Threshold, after giving effect to such
payment, is greater than or equal to 27.5% of the Revolving Credit Line Cap.
Concurrently with any prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant hereto, Borrowers
shall deliver to Administrative Agent and Term Agent a certificate of a
Financial Officer demonstrating the calculation of the amount of the
applicable net proceeds or Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, as the case may be.
In the event that Borrowers shall subsequently determine that the actual
amount received exceeded the amount set forth in such certificate, Borrowers
shall promptly make an additional prepayment of the Term Loans in an amount
equal to such excess, and Borrowers shall concurrently therewith deliver to
Administrative Agent and Term Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer
demonstrating the derivation of such excess.

  

(f)The applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the
case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the applicable Swingline Lender, and
in the case of prepayment of Term Loans, Term Agent and in the case of
Revolving Loans, Revolving Agent) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or
electronic transmission) of any prepayment hereunder (other than a prepayment
resulting from an application of funds pursuant to Section 2.09(g)) (i) in the
case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing or a Eurodollar Term
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days
before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR
Revolving Borrowing or ABR Term Borrowing not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case
of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing
or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is
given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the
Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment
may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with
Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of Term Loans, the Term
Agent) shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial
prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be
permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type
as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be
applied ratably to the Revolving Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by
Section 2.12.

  

(g)Any prepayment of the Term Loan required pursuant to this Section 2.10
shall be applied to the next four scheduled installments of principal payable
by Borrowers in respect of the Term Loans with the balance applied to the
remaining installments of principal payable by Borrowers in respect

  

66

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

of the Term Loans in the inverse order of maturity; provided that any
voluntary prepayment of the Term Loans shall be applied to the scheduled
installments of the Term Loans as Parent Borrower shall direct (or, if not so
directed, in the direct order of maturity).

  

SECTION 2.11. Fees.

  

(a)The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Revolving Agent for the account of
each Revolving Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable
Commitment Fee Percentage on the daily unused amount of the Revolving
Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment terminates.
Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March,
June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur
after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of
computing commitment fees, the Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be
deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC
Exposures of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be
considered Revolving Loans for such purposes).

  

(b)The Parent Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Revolving Agent for the
account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in (A) Stand-by Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the
Applicable Revolving Loan Margin for Eurodollar Borrowings, and (B) Trade
Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate equal to 50% of the Applicable
Revolving Loan Margin used for Eurodollar Borrowings, in each case on the
average daily amount of such Revolving Lender’s LC Exposure (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the
period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the
date on which such Lender’s Commitment terminates and the date on which such
Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a
fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum, on the
average daily amount of the LC Exposure in respect of Stand-by Letters of
Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (excluding any portion thereof attributable
to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
Closing Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the
Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well
as such Issuing Bank’s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings
thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including
the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be
payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the
first such date to occur after the Closing Date; provided that all such fees
shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and
any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments
terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing
Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand.
All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed.

  

(c)In the event that, prior to the 6 month anniversary of the Closing Date,
all or any portion of the Term Loans is (i) repaid, prepaid, refinanced or
replaced with any term loan financing, or (ii) repriced or effectively
refinanced through any waiver, consent, amendment or amendment and
restatement, and in the case of each of (i) and (ii), above, the effect
thereof is to lower the All-in Yield of the Term Loans (or portion thereof) or
new term loan financing, as applicable, from the All-in Yield of the Term
Loans (or portion thereof) so repaid, prepaid, refinanced, replaced or
repriced (a “Repricing Event”), the Borrowers shall pay to Term Agent for the
account of Term Lenders (A) in the case of clause (i), a prepayment premium
equal to 1.00% of the

  

67

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans so repaid, prepaid, refinanced,
replaced or repriced and (B) in the case of clause (ii), a fee equal to 1.00%
of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans repriced or effectively
refinanced through such waiver, consent, amendment or amendment and
restatement; provided, that, no such fee shall be payable, in the case of
clause (i) or (ii), if the Repricing Event is due to, or in connection with, a
Change in Control. If all or any portion of the Term Loans held by any Term
Lender is subject to mandatory assignment pursuant to Section 9.02(f) as a
result of, or in connection with, such Term Lender not agreeing or otherwise
consenting to any waiver, consent or amendment referred to in clause (ii)
above (or otherwise in connection with a Repricing Event) on or prior to the 6
month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Borrowers shall pay to such Term
Lender (and not any Person replacing such Term Lender pursuant to Section
9.02(f), its pro rata portion (as determined immediately prior to it being so
replaced) of the a prepayment premium under clause (ii) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Such amounts shall be due and payable on the date of
effectiveness of such Repricing Event.

  

(d)The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Revolving Agent, the Term Agent
and the Lead Arrangers, as applicable, the fees payable in the amounts and at
the times separately agreed upon between the Parent Borrower and such Agent
and Lead Arrangers.

  

(e)All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it or to the Term Agent with respect to
fees under Section 2.11(c)) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees
and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable
under any circumstances.

  

SECTION 2.12. Interest.  

    

(a)    Revolving Loans. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to it and owing to each Revolving
Lender and Swingline Lender from the date of such Revolving Loan until such
principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

  

(i)ABR Loans. During such periods as such Revolving Loan is an ABR Borrowing
(which shall be all times in the case of any Swingline Loan or Protective
Advance), a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (A) the Alternate
Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (B) the Applicable Revolving Loan
Margin for ABR Borrowings in effect from time to time.

  

(ii)Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as such Revolving Loan is a
Eurodollar Borrowing, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest
Period for such Loans to the sum of (A) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such
Interest Period for such Borrowing plus (B) the Applicable Revolving Loan
Margin for Eurodollar Loans in effect from time to time.

  

(b)     Term Loans. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal
amount of the Term Loans owing to each Term Lender from the Closing Date until
such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

  

(i)ABR Loans. During such periods as any outstanding portion of the Term Loan
is an ABR Borrowing, each such Term Loan Borrowing shall earn interest at a
rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (A) the Alternate Base Rate in
effect from time to time plus (B) the Applicable Term Loan Margin for ABR
Borrowings.

  

(ii)Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as any outstanding portion of the
Term Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, each such Term Loan Borrowing shall earn
interest at a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period
for such Eurodollar Loan to the sum of (A) the Adjusted LIBO Rate in effect
from time to time plus (B) the Applicable Term Loan Margin for Eurodollar
Loans.

        

  

68

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

(c)    Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, at the option of Revolving Agent or at the request of the
Required Revolving Lenders, Borrowers shall pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Revolving Loan and each unreimbursed LC Disbursement
owing to each Revolving Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, or at the
option of Term Agent or at the request of the Required Term Lenders, on the
principal amount of the Term Loans then outstanding, in each case at a rate
per annum equal to 2% per annum above the rate per annum otherwise required to
be paid in respect thereof.

  

(d)     Interest Payment Date; Payment Instructions. Accrued interest on each
Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan
and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Revolving
Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of
this Section or in respect of Protective Advances shall be payable on demand,
(ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a
prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability
Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of
any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the
effective date of such conversion. Interest in respect of Term Loans shall be
paid to the Term Agent for the account of the Term Lenders and interest in
respect of Revolving Loans shall be paid to the Revolving Agent for the
account of the Revolving Lenders.

  

(e)    Computation. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that all computations of interest for Alternate ABR
Loans (including ABR Loans determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate)
shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
and actual days elapsed. The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO
Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

  

SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

  

(a)the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the Term
Agent) determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

  

(b)the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their
Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

  

then the Administrative Agent or the Term Agent, as applicable shall give
notice thereof to the Parent Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy
or electronic transmission as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until
the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the Term Agent)
notifies the Parent Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving
rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that
requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing
as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing
Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an
ABR Borrowing.

SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs.



(a)Subject to Section 2.18, if any Change in Law shall:

  

69

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

(i)impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the
Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank;

  

(ii)subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B)
Taxes described in clauses (b) and (c) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and
(C) Other Connection Taxes imposed on or measured by its gross or net income,
profits or revenue (however denominated and including value-added or similar
Taxes), franchise Taxes in lieu of net income, profits or revenue Taxes or any
branch profits Taxes imposed by the United States (or any similar Tax imposed
by any other jurisdiction)) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit,
commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other
liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or

  

(iii)impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market
any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such
Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

  

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or
such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise), then the relevant Borrower will pay to such Lender and the
relevant Account Party will pay to such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered in accordance with Section 2.18.

  

(b)Subject to Section 2.18, if any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that
any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such
Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such Issuing
Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the
Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or
the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which
such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s
holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies
of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to
capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the relevant Borrower
will pay to such Lender and the relevant Account Party will pay to such
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing
Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered in accordance with
Section 2.18.

  

(c)A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive
and binding on all parties hereto absent manifest error. The relevant Borrower
shall pay such Lender and the relevant Account Party shall pay such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate
(such amount hereinafter referred to as the “Additional Costs”) within 30 days
after receipt thereof.

  

(d)Subject to Section 2.18, failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any
Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand
such compensation.

SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked
under Section 2.10(c) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the
assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Parent Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the relevant Borrower shall
compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (excluding loss of
anticipated profits or margin) attributable (other than loss of profit or
margin) to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or
expense (other than loss of profit or margin) to any Lender shall be deemed to
include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i)
the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of
such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would
have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event
to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case
of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have
been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest
which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest
rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such
period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks
in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount
or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be presumptively correct
absent manifest error. The relevant Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.

  

SECTION 2.16. Taxes.



(a)Each payment on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder to
any Recipient shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for Taxes,
unless such deduction is required by law. If any Loan Party or the
Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the Term Agent), as
applicable (any such person, a “Withholding Agent”) determines, in its sole
discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to deduct or
withhold Taxes, the Withholding Agent shall make such deductions and timely
pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the
sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) the Recipient receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made.

  

(b)In addition, the Borrowers and the Account Parties shall pay, or at the
option of the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the
Term Agent) timely reimburse it for, the payment of any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authorities in accordance with applicable law other than
any Other Taxes imposed upon any assignment or participation of a Lender’s
rights, interests and obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document;
provided that the amount such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may
be) shall be required to pay to a particular Lender in respect of Other Taxes
shall not exceed 1% of the aggregate amount of the Commitment of such Lender
on which such Other Taxes are imposed; provided further that if a Lender is
actually aware of the application of any Other Tax to any such payment,
execution, delivery or registration, such Lender shall promptly notify the
Parent Borrower of such Other Tax and the relevant Borrower or the relevant
Account Party (as the case may be) shall thereafter have the benefit of the
provisions of Section 2.18(b).

  

(c)Each Borrower and each Account Party shall indemnify each Recipient, within
30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified
Taxes (including Indemnified

  

71

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 2.16) and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether
or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by
the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of
(including calculations thereof) and the basis for such payment or liability
delivered to such Borrower or Account Party by the Recipient, or by the
Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the Term Agent) on
behalf of the Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

  

(d)Each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of
the Term Loans, the Term Agent) within 10 days after demand therefor for the
full amount of any Taxes attributable (but, in the case of any Indemnified
Taxes, only to the extent that the Borrowers and the Account Parties have not
already indemnified the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term
Loans, the Term Agent) for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the
obligation of the Borrowers and the Account Parties to do so) to such Lender
that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the
Term Loans, the Term Agent), and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as
to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the Term Agent) shall
be conclusive absent manifest error.

  

(e)Within 30 days after the date a Borrower or an Account Party receives a
receipt evidencing any payment of Indemnified Taxes by the relevant Borrower
or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) in respect of any payment
to any Recipient, such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be)
will furnish to the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans,
the Term Agent), at its address referred to in Section 9.01, the original or a
certified copy of such receipt or, if such a receipt is not available, a
certificate of the treasurer or any assistant treasurer of such Borrower or
such Account Party (as the case may be) setting forth the amount of such
payment and the date on which such payment was made.

  

(f)(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any
applicable withholding Tax with respect to payments under this Agreement shall
deliver to the Parent Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent (or,
in the case of the Term Loans, the Term Agent)), on or prior to the date on
which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement and at the time or
times reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Each Lender
shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower at any time it determines that it is
no longer in a position to provide any such previously delivered documentation
to the Parent Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such
documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section
2.16(f)(ii)(A) through (E)) below shall not be required if in the Lender’s
judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to
any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the
legal or commercial position of such Lender.

  

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender shall, to
the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Parent Borrower and
the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, Parent Borrower
and the Term Agent) (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the
Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term
Loans, Parent Borrower and the Term Agent)) on or prior to the date on which
such Lender becomes a party hereto (and from time to time thereafter upon the
request of the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of
the Term Loans, Parent Borrower and the Term Agent)), the following as
applicable:

  

72

(A)in the case of a Lender that is a U.S. Person, a duly completed and
executed IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal
backup withholding Tax,

  

(B)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming eligibility for benefits of an
income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, a duly completed and
executed IRS Form W-8BEN,

  

(C)in the case of a Foreign Lender for whom payments under this Agreement
constitute income that is effectively connected with such Foreign Lender’s
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, a duly completed and
executed IRS Form W-8ECI,

  

(D)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit D to the effect that such Foreign Lender
is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code,
(B) a “10 percent shareholder” of any Borrower within the meaning of Section
871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in
Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (D) the interest payments in question are
not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such
Lender (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) duly completed and
executed copies of IRS Form W-8 BEN,

  

(E)in the case of a Foreign Lender that is not the beneficial owner of
payments made under any Loan Document (for example, where the Foreign Lender
is a partnership or participating Lender granting a typical participation), a
duly completed and executed IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by a duly completed
and executed Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9,
and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as
applicable; provided that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a
participating Lender) and one or more beneficial owners of such Foreign Lender
are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide
a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate on behalf of such beneficial owners, and

  

(F)any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming
exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed
together with such supplementary documentation as may be reasonably requested
by the Parent Borrower in order to permit the Parent Borrower to determine the
withholding or deduction required to be made.

  

(iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject
to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail
to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA, such Lender
shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law
and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and
such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as
may be necessary for such Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations
under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such
Lender’s obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to
deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for the purposes of this Section
2.16(f)(iii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the
Closing Date.

  

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such
form or certification or promptly notify the Parent Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, Parent Borrower and
the Term Agent) in writing of its legal inability to do so.

(g)If any Recipient shall become aware that it is entitled to receive a refund
in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.16, such Recipient shall promptly
notify the Parent Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall,
within 30 days after receipt of a request by the Parent Borrower, apply for
such refund at the Parent Borrower’s expense. If any Recipient receives a
refund in respect of any Taxes for which such Recipient has received payment
from an indemnifying party hereunder, it shall within 30 days after the
receipt thereof repay the lesser of such refund and the amount paid by such
indemnifying party with respect to such Taxes to the applicable indemnifying
party, in each case net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such
Recipient and with interest received by such Recipient from the relevant
taxing authority attributable to such refund; provided that such indemnifying
party, upon the request of such Recipient, as applicable, agree to return any
such refund (plus interest, penalties and other charges) to such Recipient, as
applicable, in the event such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent
is required to pay such refund to any Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will any Issuing
Bank or Lender be required to pay any amount to any Loan Party the payment of
which would place the Issuing Bank or such Lender in a less favorable net
after-Tax position than the Issuing Bank or such Lender would have been if the
indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had
never been paid. This Section shall not be construed to require any Recipient
to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its
Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Loan Parties or any other Person.

  

(h)If (i) there is an appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent or Term Agent under Article VIII, (ii) such successor Administrative
Agent or Term Agent (a) is not a U.S. Person or (b) is a partnership or other
entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes which is
a U.S. person, but only to the extent the beneficial owners (including
indirect partners if its direct partners are partnerships or other entities
treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) are not U.S.
persons, and (iii) such successor Administrative Agent or Term Agent is
entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any applicable withholding Tax
with respect to payments under this Agreement, then such successor
Administrative Agent or Term Agent shall deliver to the Parent Borrower, on or
prior to the date on which such successor Administrative Agent or Term Agent
becomes an Administrative Agent or Term Agent under this Agreement and at the
time or times reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower, such properly
completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or
reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Such successor Administrative
Agent or Term Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower at any time it
determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any such previously
delivered documentation to the Parent Borrower. For the avoidance of doubt,
any Administrative Agent or Term Agent that is not a U.S. Person shall not be
treated as “Foreign Lender” for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the preceding three sentences, the completion,
execution and submission of such documentation described in this Section
2.16(h) shall not be required if in such successor Administrative Agent’s or
Term Agent’s judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject
such successor Administrative Agent or Term Agent to any material unreimbursed
cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position
of such successor Administrative Agent or Term Agent.

  

SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.

  

(a)Each Borrower and each Account Party shall make each payment required to be
made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of
LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or
otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder for such payment
(or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on the date when due), in immediately available funds, without set-off
or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the
discretion of the Administrative Agent in the

  

74

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

case of payments in respect of Revolving Credit Exposure and in the discretion
of the Term Agent in the case of payments in respect of Term Loans, be deemed
to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon. All such payments in respect of Revolving Credit
Exposure shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Revolving Agent
Payment Account or such other place as Administrative Agent may specify and
all such payments in respect of Term Loans shall be made to the Term Agent to
the Term Agent Payment Account or such other place as Term Agent may specify
and, except for payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or a Swingline
Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to
Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent and Term Agent, as applicable,
shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other
Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any
payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business
Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall
be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan
Document shall be made in dollars. At all times during a Cash Dominion Period,
solely for purposes of determining the amount of Revolving Loans available for
borrowing purposes, checks (in addition to immediately available funds applied
pursuant to Section 2.09(g)) from collections of items of payment and proceeds
of any Collateral shall be applied in whole or in part against the Obligations
on the Business Day after receipt, subject to actual collection.

  

(b)If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent or Term Agent, as applicable, to pay fully all amounts of
principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due
hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest
and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and
(ii) second, towards payment of principal (and in the case of Revolving
Lenders, unreimbursed LC Disbursements) then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal (and
unreimbursed LC Disbursements as applicable) then due to such parties.

  

(c)If any Revolving Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements,
Protective Advances or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving
payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements, Protective Advances and Swingline
Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion to which it would be
entitled based on its Applicable Revolving Percentage, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements
and Swingline Loans of other Revolving Lenders in the case of such amounts
received by a Revolving Lender to the extent necessary so that the benefit of
all such payments shall be shared by the Revolving Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements,
Protective Advances and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such
participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise
thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment
made by any Borrower or any Account Party pursuant to and in accordance with
the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by the
Administrative Agent in respect of any Protective Advance or by a Lender as
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its
Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant,
other than to Holdings or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the
provisions of this paragraph shall apply).

  

(d)If any Term Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or similar right, obtain payment in respect of any principal of
or interest on any of its Term Loans, such Term

  

75

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Lender shall remit such payments to Administrative Agent for application to
the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.17(h).

  

(e)Each of the Borrowers and each of the Account Parties consents to the
foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable
law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against such Borrower or such Account Party (as the
case may be) rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such
Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) in the amount of such
participation.

  

(f)Unless the Administrative Agent or Term Agent shall have received notice
from a Borrower or an Account Party prior to the date on which any payment is
due to Administrative Agent or Term Agent, as the case may be, from such
Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) for the account of the
Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower or such Account Party
(as the case may be) will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent or
the Term Agent, as applicable, may assume that such Borrower or such Account
Party (as the case may be) has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders
or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such
event, if the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may
be) has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent or the Term Agent, as applicable, forthwith on demand the
amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed
to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent or Term
Agent, as applicable, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a
rate determined by the Administrative Agent or Term Agent, as applicable, in
accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

  

(g)If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it
pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(iii), 2.04(b)(ii), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or
2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent or the Term Agent, as applicable may,
in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Revolving Agent or the Term Agent, as
applicable for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations
under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

  

(h)Any proceeds of Collateral or any other amounts received by Revolving Agent
and Term Agent, as applicable in accordance with this Agreement or another
Loan Document (i) not constituting either (A) a specific payment of principal,
interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be
applied as specified by the Borrowers), (B) a mandatory prepayment under
Section 2.10 (which shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.10), (C)
amounts to be used to cash collateralize LC Exposures, (D) amounts to be
applied from the Concentration Account or any other Control Account during any
Cash Dominion Period (which shall be applied in accordance with Section
2.09(g)) or (ii) after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and
the Administrative Agent so elects or the Required Lenders so direct, shall be
applied ratably to the Obligations as follows: first, to pay any fees,
indemnities, or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent,
the Term Agent, the Co-Collateral Agents, any Issuing Lender or the Swingline
Lender under any Loan Document (other than in connection with Secured Swap
Obligations, Secured Supply Chain Obligations and Secured Treasury Services
Obligations), second, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to
the Revolving Lenders from the Loan Parties in respect of Loan Document
Obligations, third, to pay interest due in respect of the Protective Advances,
fourth, to pay the principal of the Protective Advances, fifth, to pay
interest then due and payable on the Revolving Loans (other than the
Protective Advances) or unreimbursed LC Disbursements ratably, sixth, to
prepay principal on the Revolving Loans (other than

  

76

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

the Protective Advances), unreimbursed LC Disbursements and (in an amount not
to exceed the Designated Secured Obligations Reserve then in effect) the
Designated Secured Swap Obligations and the Designated Secured Treasury
Services Obligations ratably, seventh, to the payment of any other Loan
Document Obligations due to the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Lender
from the Loan Parties, eighth, to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent
equal to one hundred three percent (103%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount
of all outstanding Letters of Credit, to be held as cash collateral for such
Obligations (provided, that, any remaining cash collateral held for any
Letters of Credit shall, upon expiration of all Letters of Credit and after
reimbursement of all drawings thereunder and fees and expenses related
thereto, be applied to the other Obligations in the order specified in this
Section 2.17(h)), ninth, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to
the Term Lenders from the Loan Parties in respect of Loan Document
Obligations, tenth, to pay interest due in respect of the Term Loans,
eleventh, to pay the principal of the Term Loans, twelfth, to the payment of
any other Loan Document Obligations due to any Term Lender from the Loan
Parties, thirteenth to the payment of any amounts owing with respect to
Secured Swap Obligations and Secured Treasury Services Obligations, and
fourteenth, to the payment of any amounts owing with respect to Secured Supply
Chain Obligations. Any payments in respect of Additional Term Loans shall only
be applied to such Additional Term Loans either pari passu with, or after the
payment in full of, the principal of the other Term Loans pursuant to the
priority of application of payments set forth above. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Parent
Borrower, or unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
neither the Revolving Agent and Term Agent, as applicable nor any Lender shall
apply any payment that it receives to a Eurodollar Loan, except (x) on the
expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such Eurodollar Loan
or (y) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding ABR
Loans of the applicable Class and, in any such event, the Borrowers shall pay
the break funding payment required in accordance with Section 2.15. While any
Event of Default is continuing, the Administrative Agent, the Term Agent and
the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse
and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the
Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

  

(a)If, with respect to any Lender, any Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent
or the Term Agent, an event or circumstance occurs that would entitle such
Lender or Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, or the Term Agent to
exercise any of the rights or benefits afforded by Section 2.14 or 2.16(a),
such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, promptly upon
becoming aware of the same, shall take all steps as may be reasonably
available (including designating a different Applicable Lending Office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or participating in Letters of Credit
or assigning its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,
or furnishing the proper certificates under any applicable Tax laws, Tax
treaties, conventions and governmental regulations to the extent that such
certificates are legally available to such Lender, Issuing Bank,
Administrative Agent or Term Agent) to eliminate or mitigate the effects of
any event resulting in the ability of such Lender, the Administrative Agent or
Term Agent to exercise rights under any of such Sections; provided that none
of any Lender, any Issuing Bank, Administrative Agent or Term Agent shall be
under any obligation to take any step that, in its reasonable judgment, would
(i) result in its incurring Additional Costs or Taxes in performing its
obligations hereunder unless the Borrowers and the Account Parties have
expressly agreed to reimburse it therefor or (ii) be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender, Issuing Bank, Administrative Agent or Term
Agent. Within 60 days after the occurrence of any event giving rise to any
rights or benefits provided by Sections 2.14 and 2.16(a) in favor of any
Lender, Issuing Bank, Administrative Agent or Term Agent, such Lender or
Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent (i) will notify the Parent Borrower
of such event or circumstance and (ii) provide the Parent Borrower with a
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail (x) the event or circumstance
giving rise to any benefit under Sections 2.14 and 2.16(a), (y) the effective
date of, and the time period during which, compensation for

  

77

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

any Additional Costs or Taxes are being claimed and (z) the determination of
amount or amounts claimed thereby and detailed calculations with respect
thereto; provided that, if such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative
Agent does not give the Parent Borrower such notice and certificate within the
60-day period set forth in this sentence, the relevant Borrower or the
relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall be required to indemnify
such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent only for such
Additional Costs and Taxes as are attributable to the period from and after
the first date as of which such notice and certificate have been received by
the Parent Borrower. Such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent
shall notify the Parent Borrower of any change in circumstances with respect
to the event specified in the above-described notice and certificate as
promptly as practicable after such Lender or Issuing Bank or the
Administrative Agent obtains knowledge thereof. Such certificate shall be
presumptively correct absent manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall deliver
the notice and certificate described in this paragraph (a) to the Parent
Borrower in respect of any Additional Costs or Taxes unless it is then the
general policy of such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent to
pursue similar rights and remedies in similar circumstances under comparable
provisions of other credit agreements.

  

(b)With respect to Sections 2.14 and 2.16, the Parent Borrower shall have the
right, should any Lender request any compensation or indemnity thereunder, or
if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender is a Declining
Lender, to (i) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, (A) promptly terminate such Lender’s Commitment by irrevocable
written notice of such termination to such Lender and the Administrative Agent
without the necessity of complying with Sections 2.08(b) and (c) hereof, (B)
reduce the total Commitments by the amount of such Lender’s Commitment and (C)
pay or prepay in immediately available funds all Loans owing to such Lender,
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts
payable to it hereunder, or (ii) require such Lender to assign all its
interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement, without recourse to or
representation or warranty by such Lender, to an assignee in accordance with
Section 9.04 (provided that the failure of any such Defaulting Lender to
execute an Assignment and Assumption shall not render such assignment invalid
and such assignment shall be recorded in the Register and any notes held by
such Lender shall be automatically deemed cancelled upon such failure);
provided that (x) such assignment shall not conflict with any statute, law,
rule, regulation, order or decree of any Governmental Authority, (y) the
assigning Lender shall have received from the relevant Borrower and the
relevant Account Party and/or such assignee full payment in immediately
available funds of the principal of and interest accrued on the Loans to the
date of such assignment made by it hereunder and all other amounts owed to it
hereunder that are subject to such assignment, provided that amounts payable
under this clause (y) to any assigning Lender that is a Defaulting Lender
shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.21(e), and (z) in the case of
any such assignment resulting from a Lender being a Declining Lender, the
assignee shall have agreed to the applicable Maturity Date Extension Request.

  

(c)With respect to Section 2.14 or 2.16, (i) other than with respect to
Section 2.16(b), none of any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to exercise any right or benefit afforded thereby and
neither the Borrowers nor the Account Parties shall be obligated to reimburse
any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent pursuant to such
Sections unless (x) such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent
has delivered to the Parent Borrower in accordance with Section 9.01 the
notice and the certificate described in Section 2.18(a) hereof and (y) the
Parent Borrower has had a 30-Business Day period following the receipt of such
notice and certificate (if the Parent Borrower in good faith disagrees with
the assertion that any payment under such Sections is due or with the amount
shown as due on such certificate and so notifies the applicable Lender or
Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent of such disagreement within 10
Business Days following receipt of the notice and certificate) to negotiate
with the requesting Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, which
negotiations shall be conducted by the respective parties in good faith, and
to agree upon another amount that will adequately compensate such Lender or
Issuing Bank or the Administrative

  

78

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Agent, it being expressly understood that if the Parent Borrower does not
provide the required notice of its disagreement as provided above, the
relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall pay
the amount shown as due on the certificate on the tenth Business Day following
receipt thereof and further if the Parent Borrower does provide such required
notice, and negotiations are entered into but do not result in agreement by
the Parent Borrower and such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative
Agent within the 30-Business Day period, then the relevant Borrower or the
relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall pay the amount shown as due
on the certificate on the last day of such period, but in either event not
earlier than the date as of which the relevant Additional Costs or Taxes are
incurred, (ii) other than with respect to Other Taxes, unless the appropriate
notice and certificate are delivered to the Parent Borrower within the 60-day
period described in Section 2.18(a), the relevant Borrower or the relevant
Account Party (as the case may be) shall be liable only for Additional Costs,
Taxes or amounts required to be paid which are attributable to the period from
and after the date such notice and certificate have been received by such
Borrower or such Account Party, as applicable, (iii) neither the Borrowers nor
the Account Parties shall be liable for any amounts incurred as a result of
any change in an Applicable Lending Office of any Issuing Bank or Lender to
the extent that such Issuing Bank or Lender shall have had knowledge at the
time of such change in Applicable Lending Office that reimbursement or
recoupment under Section 2.14 would arise as a result of such change, (iv)
each Lender, each Issuing Bank and/or the Administrative Agent, as applicable,
shall in good faith allocate all Additional Costs, Taxes and payments required
to be made fairly among all its commitments (whether or not it seeks
compensation from all affected Borrowers or Account Parties), (v) none of any
Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
exercise any right or benefit afforded hereby or receive any payment otherwise
due under Sections 2.14 and 2.16 (including, without limitation, any repayment
by any Borrower or any Account Party (as the case may be) of any refund of
Taxes pursuant to Section 2.16(g)) which arises from any bad faith, gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the
Administrative Agent, or the failure of such Lender or Issuing Bank or the
Administrative Agent to comply with the terms of this Agreement, (vi) if any
Lender or any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall have recouped any
amount or received any offsetting Tax benefit (other than a refund of Taxes as
described in Section 2.16(g)) or reserve or capital benefits theretofore paid
to it by any Borrower or any Account Party (as the case may be), such Lender
or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such
Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) an amount equal to the
amount of the recoupment received by such Lender or Issuing Bank or the
Administrative Agent reduced by any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such
Lender or the Administrative Agent attributable to such recoupment, as
determined in good faith by such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative
Agent, and (vii) the liability of the Borrowers and the Account Parties to any
Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any
Indemnified Taxes shall be reduced to the extent that such Lender or Issuing
Bank or the Administrative Agent receives an offsetting Tax benefit (or could
have received such a benefit by taking reasonable measures to receive it);
provided that there shall not be any reductions pursuant to this clause (vii)
with respect to any Tax benefit (x) the existence of which such Lender or
Issuing Bank or Administrative Agent is unaware, (y) the claiming of which
would result in any cost or Tax to such Lender or Issuing Bank or the
Administrative Agent (unless the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account
Party (as the case may be) shall have agreed to pay its reasonably allocable
portion of such cost or Tax) and (z) unless the relevant Borrower or the
relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall agree to indemnify the
applicable Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent to the extent
any Tax benefit taken into account under this clause (vii) is thereafter lost
or becomes unavailable.

  

(d)In addition to their obligations under Section 2.14 hereof, each of the
Lenders, each of the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent hereby agrees
to execute and deliver, and to make any required filings of, all certificates,
agreements, documents, reports, statements and other instruments as are
reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section 2.18 and
Sections 2.14 and 2.16. The

  

79

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Parent Borrower agrees to pay all filing fees incurred by any Lender, any
Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent in performing its obligations under
this Section 2.18.

  

SECTION 2.19. Settlement Among Lenders.

  

(a)The amount of each Lender's Applicable Revolving Percentage of outstanding
Revolving Loans (including outstanding Swingline Loans) shall be computed
weekly (or more frequently in the Revolving Agent's discretion) and shall be
adjusted upward or downward based on all Revolving Loans (including Swingline
Loans) and repayments of Revolving Loans (including Swingline Loans) received
by the Revolving Agent as of 3:00 p.m. on the first Business Day (such date,
the "Settlement Date") following the end of the period specified by the
Revolving Agent.

  

(b)The Revolving Agent shall deliver to each of the Revolving Lenders promptly
after a Settlement Date a summary statement of the amount of outstanding
Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans for the period and the amount of
repayments received for the period. As reflected on the summary statement, (i)
the Revolving Agent shall transfer to each Revolving Lender its Applicable
Revolving Percentage of repayments, and (ii) each Revolving Lender shall
transfer to the Revolving Agent (as provided below) or the Revolving Agent
shall transfer to each Lender, such amounts as are necessary to insure that,
after giving effect to all such transfers, the amount of the Revolving Loans
made by each Revolving Lender shall be equal to such Lender's Applicable
Revolving Percentage of all Revolving Loans outstanding as of such Settlement
Date. If the summary statement requires transfers to be made to the Revolving
Agent by the Lenders and is received prior to 1:00 p.m. on a Business Day,
such transfers shall be made in immediately available funds no later than 3:00
p.m. that day; and, if received after 1:00 p.m., then no later than 3:00 p.m.
on the next Business Day. The obligation of each Revolving Lender to transfer
such funds is irrevocable, unconditional and without recourse to or warranty
by the Revolving Agent. If and to the extent any Revolving Lender shall not
have so made its transfer to the Revolving Agent, such Revolving Lender agrees
to pay to the Revolving Agent, forthwith on demand such amount, together with
interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is
paid to the Revolving Agent, equal to the greater of the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Revolving Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation plus any administrative,
processing, or similar fees customarily charged by the Revolving Agent in
connection with the foregoing.

  

SECTION 2.20. Borrowing Subsidiaries. The Parent Borrower may, at any time and
from time to time so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, designate any Material Subsidiary (other than any Foreign
Subsidiary) to be a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder by delivering to the
Administrative Agent a Subsidiary Borrowing Election with respect to such
Material Subsidiary. The eligibility of any Borrowing Subsidiary to borrow
hereunder shall terminate when the Administrative Agent receives a Subsidiary
Borrower Termination with respect to such Material Subsidiary. Each Subsidiary
Borrower Election delivered to the Administration Agent shall be duly executed
on behalf of the relevant Material Subsidiary and the Parent Borrower, and
each Subsidiary Borrower Termination delivered to the Administrative Agent
shall be duly executed on behalf of the Parent Borrower. The delivery of a
Subsidiary Borrower Termination shall not affect any obligation of the
relevant Material Subsidiary incurred in its capacity as a Borrower, and such
Material Subsidiary shall continue to constitute a Borrowing Subsidiary for
all purposes hereof (other than the right to borrow Loans) until all its
obligations hereunder as a Borrower have been discharged and paid in full. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Lenders and the Issuing
Banks of its receipt of any Subsidiary Borrower Election or Subsidiary
Borrower Termination.

SECTION 2.21. Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the
following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender:

  

(a)fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving
Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);

  

(b)the Revolving Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting
Lender and the Term Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in
determining whether all Lenders, the Required Lenders, the Required Revolving
Lenders, the Supermajority Required Lenders or the Required Term Lenders have
taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment
or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02), provided that (i) such Defaulting
Lender’s Revolving Commitment may not be increased or extended without its
consent and (ii) the principal amount of, or interest or fees payable on, such
Defaulting Lender’s Loans or participations in LC Disbursements may not be
reduced or excused or the scheduled date of payment may not be postponed as to
such Defaulting Lender without such Defaulting Lender’s consent;

  

(c)if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists, or any Protective Advance
is outstanding, at the time a Revolving Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender
then:

  

(i)all or any part of such Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure and
participations in Protective Advances shall be reallocated among the non-
Defaulting Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable
Revolving Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting
Revolving Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s
Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure and participations in Protective Advances
does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Commitments (it being
understood that in no event shall any non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit
Exposure exceed such Lender’s Commitment as a result of such reallocation) and
(y) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time;

  

(ii)if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only
partially, be effected, the Borrowers or the Account Parties shall within two
Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (A) first, prepay
such Swingline Exposure and Protective Advances and (B) second, cash
collateralize (or, if approved by each applicable Issuing Bank in its sole
discretion, otherwise provide credit support for) such Defaulting Lender’s LC
Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause
(i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for
so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;

  

(iii)if the Borrowers or the Account Parties cash collateralize, or otherwise
provide credit support for, any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC
Exposure pursuant to this paragraph (c), the Borrowers shall not be required
to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with
respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such
Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is cash collateralized or otherwise has credit
support provided therefor;

  

(iv)if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant
to this paragraph (c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to
Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such
non-Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable Revolving Percentages; and

  

(v)if any Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized, nor
otherwise has credit support provided therefor nor is reallocated pursuant to
this paragraph (c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the
Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of

  

  

81

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting
Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until such LC
Exposure is cash collateralized, otherwise has credit support provided
therefor and/or is reallocated;

  

(d)so long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline
Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank
shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless
it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the
Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders and/or cash
collateral (or other credit support, if approved by each applicable Issuing
Bank in its sole discretion) will be provided by the Borrowers or the Account
Parties in accordance with Section 2.21(c), and participating interests in any
such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan
shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders in a manner
consistent with Section 2.21(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not
participate therein); and

  

(e)any amount payable to a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender
hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise and
including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender
pursuant to Section 2.17(c), but excluding Section 2.18(b)) shall, in lieu of
being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Administrative
Agent in a segregated account (which may be invested as requested by the
Parent Borrower, at the Parent Borrower’s risk and expense, subject to
approval by the Administrative Agent) and, subject to any applicable
requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by
the Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts (other than
in respect of Protective Advances) owing by such Defaulting Lender to the
Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, pro rata, to the payment of any
amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank or Swingline
Lender hereunder or to the Administrative Agent in respect of Protective
Advances, (iii) third, as the Parent Borrower may request (so long as no
Default has occurred and is continuing) to the funding of any Loan or the
funding or cash collateralization of any participating interest in any
Swingline Loan, Protective Advance or Letter of Credit in respect of which
such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by
this Agreement (such amounts to be determined by the Administrative Agent in
consultation with the Parent Borrower), (iv) fourth, if so determined by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrowers or the Account Parties, held in such
account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting
Lender under this Agreement, (v) fifth, pro rata, to the payment of any
amounts owing to the Borrowers, the Account Parties or the Lenders as a result
of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the
Borrowers, the Account Parties or any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as
a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this
Agreement and (vi) sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed
by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is (A) a
prepayment of the principal amount of any Loans or reimbursement obligations
in respect of LC Disbursements which a Defaulting Lender has funded its
participation obligations and (B) made at a time when the conditions set forth
in Section 4.02 are satisfied, such payment shall be applied solely to prepay
the Loans of, and reimbursement obligations owed to, all non-Defaulting
Lenders pro rata prior to being applied to the prepayment of any Loans, or
reimbursement obligations owed to, any Defaulting Lender.

  

(f)In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers, the Account
Parties, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a
Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender
to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the
Lenders, and their participations in Protective Advances, shall be readjusted
to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Commitment and on such date such
Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other
than Swingline Loans and Protective Advances) as the Administrative Agent
shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans
in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. For the avoidance of doubt, no
adjustments will be made retroactively with

  

82

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

respect to fees that ceased to accrue pursuant to clause (a) above while such
Lender was a Defaulting Lender or payments that were allocated pursuant to
clause (e) above while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender.

  

SECTION 2.22. Increase in Commitments and Additional Term Loans.

  

(a)At any time after the Closing Date, the Parent Borrower may, by written
notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to
each of the Lenders), request at any time or from time to time that the
Revolving Maximum Credit be increased; provided that (i) the aggregate amount
of each such increase pursuant to this Section 2.22 (each a “Revolving
Commitment Increase”) shall not be less than $50,000,000 and the amount of (A)
all such Revolving Commitment Increases pursuant to this Section 2.22, plus
(B) the amount of any outstanding Additional Term Loans made pursuant to this
Section 2.22, minus (C) the amount of any of the Term Loans that have been
repaid, shall not exceed $300,000,000, (ii) each such request of the Parent
Borrower shall be deemed to be an offer to each Revolving Lender to increase
its Revolving Commitment by its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the
proposed increased amount, (iii) each Revolving Lender, in its sole
discretion, may either (A) agree to increase its Revolving Commitment by all
or a portion of the offered amount or (B) decline to increase its Revolving
Commitment, (iv) each such Revolving Commitment Increase will be documented
solely as an increase to the Revolving Commitments without any change in terms
(except as provided in clause (vii) below), (v) as of the date of any such
Revolving Commitment Increase and after giving effect thereto, no Default or
Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, (vi) no
Revolving Lender shall be required to increase its Revolving Commitment for
such Revolving Commitment Increase, (vii) except for the initial fee payable
in respect of the Revolving Commitment Increase of any Revolving Lender, the
terms of such Revolving Commitment Increase and the Revolving Loans pursuant
thereto shall be the same as for all other Revolving Loans and Revolving
Commitments, including in the event that the fees, interest rate and other
compensation offered or paid in respect of any Revolving Commitment Increase
(other than the initial fee payable in respect of the Revolving Commitment
Increase of any Revolving Lender) are higher than the amounts paid and payable
to the then existing Revolving Lenders in respect of their existing
Commitments and Loans pursuant thereto, the fees, interest rate and other
compensation payable to the existing Revolving Lenders in respect of their
existing Commitments and Loans pursuant thereto shall be increased to the same
as those paid in connection with the Revolving Commitment Increase, except for
the initial fee payable in respect of the Revolving Commitment Increase of a
Revolving Lender, (ix) the Parent Borrower shall not make more than a total of
five requests for any Revolving Commitment Increase and Additional Term Loans
(other than any Revolving Commitment Increase made in respect of Term Loans
that have been repaid), (x) after giving effect to any Revolving Commitment
Increase, the Revolving Maximum Credit and the outstanding Term Loans shall
not exceed $2,650,000,000, and (xi) to the extent that such Revolving
Commitment Increase is not then permitted under the Existing Term Loan
Agreement or any other agreement governing any Indebtedness of the Loan
Parties or such Revolving Commitment Increase would give rise to the
obligation to grant a Lien on any assets of the Loan Parties, Parent Borrower
shall have obtained the required consents or waivers so as to permit such
Revolving Commitment Increase and to not require the grant of any such Lien.
In the event that the Revolving Lenders shall have agreed to increase their
Revolving Commitments by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the
total Revolving Commitments requested by the Parent Borrower, the Parent
Borrower may arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions
(any bank or other financial institution increasing its Revolving Commitment
or providing a new Revolving Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.22 being
called an “Augmenting Revolving Lender”), which may include any Revolving
Lender, to provide Revolving Commitments or increase its existing Revolving
Commitment in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount; provided
that each Augmenting Revolving Lender, if not already a Revolving Lender (or
an Affiliate of a Revolving Lender) hereunder, shall be subject to the
approval of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld);
provided further that any individual Revolving Commitment extended or
increased pursuant to this Section 2.22 shall be in

  

83

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

a minimum amount of $10,000,000 (or, if less, the balance of the unsubscribed
amount of the requested increase in total Revolving Commitments). Increases of
Revolving Commitments and new Revolving Commitments created pursuant to this
clause (a) shall become effective upon the execution and delivery by the
Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent and any Revolving Lenders (including
any Augmenting Revolving Lenders) agreeing to increase their existing
Commitments or extend new Commitments, as the case may be, of an amendment to
this Agreement providing for such increased or additional Commitments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Revolving Maximum Credit (or
in the Revolving Commitment of any Lender) shall become effective under this
clause (a) unless, on the date of such increase and after giving effect
thereto, (A) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02(a) and 4.02(b) shall be
satisfied (as though a Borrowing were being made on such date, with all
references in such Section to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to
such increase), (B) each of the conditions set forth above are satisfied and
(C) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect
dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Parent Borrower.

  

(b)At the time that any Revolving Commitment Increase becomes effective, if
any Revolving Loans are outstanding, the Parent Borrower shall prepay the
aggregate principal amount outstanding in respect of such Revolving Loans in
accordance with Section 2.10 (the “Initial Loans”); provided that (i) nothing
in this Section 2.22 shall prevent the Parent Borrower from funding the
prepayment of Initial Loans with concurrent Revolving Loans hereunder in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, giving effect to the
Commitment Increase, and (ii) no such prepayment shall be required if, after
giving effect to the Commitment Increase, each Revolving Lender has the same
Applicable Revolving Percentage as immediately prior to such Revolving
Commitment Increase.

  

(c)At any time after the Closing Date, the Parent Borrower may, by written
notice to the Administrative Agent and the Term Agent (which shall promptly
deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), request at any time or from time to
time that additional Term Loans or an additional Class of term loans be made
pursuant to this Section 2.22 (the “Additional Term Loans”), which notice
shall set forth the amount of the requested Additional Term Loans and the date
on which such Additional Term Loans are to be made; provided that (i) the
aggregate amount of Additional Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.22 shall
not be less than $50,000,000 and the aggregate amount of Additional Term
Loans, plus the amount of all Revolving Commitment Increases pursuant to this
Section 2.22, shall not, at the time of making of any such Additional Term
Loan and after giving effect thereto, exceed $300,000,000, (ii) as of the date
of any such Additional Term Loans and after giving effect thereto, no Default
or Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, (iii) no
Term Lender shall be required to make any Additional Term Loans, (iv) the
amount of any Revolving Loans, LC Exposure, the Term Loans and any Additional
Term Loans shall not exceed the Borrowing Base (calculated without giving
effect to the Term Loan Reserve), (v) the Parent Borrower shall not make more
than a total of five requests for Additional Term Loans and Revolving
Commitment Increases (other than Revolving Commitment Increases in respect of
any Term Loans that have been repaid), (vi) the Additional Term Loans shall
mature no earlier than, and will have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity no
shorter than, that of the then existing Term Loans, (vii) with respect to
mandatory prepayments, the Additional Term Loans shall not participate on a
greater than pro rata basis than the then existing Term Loans, (viii) the
interest rate margins and original issue discount or upfront fees (if any) and
interest rate floors (if any) applicable to any Additional Term Loans shall be
determined by the Parent Borrower and the Term Lenders thereunder, provided
that if the All-in Yield in respect of any Additional Term Loans exceeds the
All-in Yield on the then existing Term Loans by more than 50 basis points, the
applicable margins for the existing Term Loans shall be increased to the
extent necessary so that the All-in Yield on the existing Term Loans is 50
basis points less than the All-in Yield on the Additional Term Loans, (ix)
after giving effect to any Additional Term Loans, the Revolving Maximum Credit
and the outstanding Term Loans shall not exceed $2,650,000,000, (x) all other
terms of any such Additional Term Loans shall be determined by the Parent
Borrower, Administrative Agent, Term Agent and the Lenders with respect to
such Additional Term Loans as specified in the

  

84

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

documentation governing such Additional Term Loans, and (xi) to the extent
that such Additional Term Loans are not permitted under the Existing Term Loan
Agreement or any other agreement governing any Indebtedness of the Loan
Parties or such Additional Term Loans would give rise to the obligation to
grant a Lien on any assets of the Loan Parties, Parent Borrower shall have
obtained the required consents or waivers so as to permit such Additional Term
Loans and to not require the grant of any such Lien. At the Parent Borrower’s
option, Additional Term Loans may be provided by existing Lenders that have
agreed to provide such Additional Term Loans or by one or more banks or other
financial institutions (any bank or other financial institution making such
Additional Term Loans or providing new Term Loans pursuant to this Section
2.22 being called an “Augmenting Term Lender”); provided that each Augmenting
Term Lender, if not already a Term Lender (or an Affiliate of a Term Lender)
hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Term Agent and
Administrative Agent (as to each not to be unreasonably withheld); provided
further that any Additional Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.22 shall be
in a minimum amount of $10,000,000 (or, if less, the balance of the
unsubscribed amount of the requested Additional Term Loans). Additional Term
Loans made pursuant to this clause (c) shall become effective upon the
execution and delivery by the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
Term Agent and any Term Lenders (including any Augmenting Term Lenders)
agreeing to make such Additional Term Loans of an amendment to this Agreement
providing for such Additional Term Loans and any technical amendments as may
be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Term Agent and
Parent Borrower to implement such Additional Term Loans. This Section 2.22
supersedes any provision in Section 9.02 to the contrary, provided, that,
Section 9.02(b)(iv) shall be applicable to the extent provided therein. Any
payments in respect of Additional Term Loans shall only be applied to such
Additional Term Loans either pari passu with, or after the payment in full of,
the principal of the other Term Loans pursuant to the priority of application
of payments set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Additional Term Loans shall become effective under this clause (c) unless, on
the date of such increase and after giving effect thereto, (A) the conditions
set forth in Section 4.02(a) and 4.02(b) shall be satisfied (as though a
Borrowing were being made on such date, with all references in such Section to
a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such increase), (B) each of the
conditions set forth above are satisfied and (C) the Administrative Agent
shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed
by a Financial Officer of the Parent Borrower.

  

SECTION 2.23. Extension of Maturity Date. The Parent Borrower may, by delivery
of a written request (a “Maturity Date Extension Request”) to the
Administrative Agent (and with respect to Maturity Date Extension Request with
respect to the Term Loans, Term Agent) (which shall promptly deliver a copy to
each of the Lenders), request that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date then
in effect; provided that (i) such request shall be made to all Lenders having
the same Maturity Date on the same terms and (ii) in no event shall there be
more than two different Scheduled Maturity Dates in respect of all Revolving
Loans and two different Scheduled Maturity Dates in respect of all Term Loans.
Such Maturity Date Extension Request shall set forth (A) any changes to
interest rate margins, fees or other pricing that will apply to the extensions
of credit by Lenders that elect to agree to such Maturity Date Extension
Request (which may be higher or lower than those that apply before giving
effect to such Maturity Date Extension Request) and (B) any covenants or other
terms that will apply solely to any period after the latest Maturity Date (if
any) applicable to any Lenders that have a Scheduled Maturity Date earlier
than the Scheduled Maturity Date that will apply to Lenders that elect to
agree to such Maturity Date Extension Request. Other than the extended
Maturity Date and the changes described in clauses (A) and (B) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the terms applicable to Lenders that elect to
agree to such Maturity Date Extension Request shall be identical to those that
applied before giving effect thereto.

  

(b) Each Lender shall, by notice to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative
Agent (and with respect to Maturity Date Extension Request with respect to the
Term Loans, Term Agent) given not later than the 20th day after the date of
the Administrative Agent’s receipt of the Borrower’s Maturity Date Extension
Request (or such other date as the Parent Borrower and the Administrative
Agent may

  

85

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

agree, and with respect to Maturity Date Extension Request with respect to the
Term Loans, Term Agent; such date, the “Extension Date”), advise the Parent
Borrower whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (each Lender
agreeing to a requested extension being called a “Consenting Lender”, and each
Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a “Declining
Lender”). Any Lender that has not so advised the Parent Borrower, the
Administrative Agent (and with respect to Maturity Date Extension Request with
respect to the Term Loans, Term Agent) by such Extension Date shall be deemed
to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a Declining Lender.

  

(c) The Latest Maturity Date then in effect shall, as to the Consenting
Lenders, be extended to the date set forth in the Maturity Date Extension
Request. The decision to agree or withhold agreement to any Maturity Date
Extension Request shall be at the sole discretion of each Lender. The
Commitment of any Declining Lender shall terminate on the Maturity Date in
effect prior to giving effect to any such extension (such Maturity Date being
called the “Existing Maturity Date”). The principal amount of any outstanding
Loans made by Declining Lenders, together with any accrued interest thereon
and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such
Declining Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Existing Maturity
Date, and on the Existing Maturity Date the Parent Borrower shall also make
such other prepayments of Loans pursuant to Section 2.10 as shall be required
in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of,
and all payments to, Declining Lenders pursuant to this sentence, the total
Revolving Credit Exposures would not exceed the Revolving Credit Line Cap.

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.23, the Parent
Borrower shall have the right, pursuant to Section 2.18(b), at any time prior
to the Existing Maturity Date, to replace a Declining Lender with a bank or
other financial institution that will agree to the applicable Maturity Date
Extension Request (provided that each such bank or other financial
institution, if not already a Lender (or an Affiliate of a Lender) hereunder,
shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (and with respect
to Maturity Date Extension Request with respect to the Term Loans, Term Agent)
(in each case not to be unreasonably withheld)), and any such replacement
Lender shall for all purposes constitute a Consenting Lender.

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.23, no
extension of the Maturity Date then in effect pursuant to this Section 2.23
shall become effective unless, on or promptly following the Extension Date,
the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied (with all
references in such Section to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to
such extension) and the Administrative Agent (and with respect to Maturity
Date Extension Request with respect to the Term Loans, Term Agent) shall have
received a certificate to that effect dated the Extension Date and executed by
a Financial Officer of the Parent Borrower.

  

(f) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent (and in
the case of extensions with respect to the Term Loans, the Term Agent) to
enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (an
“Extension Amendment”) with the Borrowers as may be necessary in order to
effectuate the extensions contemplated by this Section 2.23 and such technical
amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the
Administrative Agent (and with respect to Maturity Date Extension Request with
respect to the Term Loans, Term Agent) and the Parent Borrower in connection
with such extension. This Section 2.23 supersedes any provisions in Section
9.02 to the contrary. Extensions will not constitute a voluntary or mandatory
payment or prepayment for purposes of this Agreement.

dissolution permitted under Section 6.03 and, in the case of an asset
transfer, Section 6.05.

  

SECTION 5.05. Payment of Obligations. Each of Holdings and the Parent Borrower
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay its obligations,
including Tax liabilities, that, if not paid, would result in a Material
Adverse Effect before the same shall become delinquent or in default, except
where (a) the validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by
appropriate

  

96

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

proceedings, (b) Holdings, the Parent Borrower or such Subsidiary has set
aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance with
GAAP and (c) the failure to make payment pending such contest would not result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

  

SECTION 5.06. Maintenance of Properties. Each of Holdings and the Parent
Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep and maintain
all property material to the conduct of the business of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) in good working order and condition, ordinary
wear and tear, condemnation and casualty loss excepted, except where the
failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit the disposition of any
property otherwise permitted by this Agreement; provided, further, that
nothing in this Section shall prevent Holdings or any Subsidiary from
discontinuing the operations or maintenance of any of its properties no longer
deemed by Holdings or such Subsidiary, as applicable, to be useful in the
conduct of its business.

  

SECTION 5.07. Insurance. Each of Holdings and the Parent Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Material Subsidiaries to, maintain, (1) with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies or (2) (other than with
respect to Inventory) with association or captive insurance companies or
pursuant to self-insurance, (a) insurance in such amounts (with no greater
risk retention) and against such risks (including physical loss or damage to
the Collateral (including all Inventory constituting Collateral)) as are
customarily maintained by companies of established repute engaged in the same
or similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations and (b)
without duplication, all insurance required to be maintained pursuant to the
Collateral Agreement. Policies maintained with respect to any Collateral shall
be endorsed or otherwise amended to include a lenders’ loss payable clause in
favor of the Administrative Agent and providing for losses thereunder to be
payable to the Administrative Agent or its designee, provided that, unless an
Event of Default or a Cash Dominion Period shall have occurred and be
continuing, (A) the Administrative Agent shall turn over to the Parent
Borrower any amounts received by it as loss payee under any such policies and
(B) Holdings, Parent Borrower and/or the applicable Material Subsidiary shall
have the sole right to make, settle and adjust claims in respect of such
insurance. Each such policy referred to in this paragraph also shall provide
that it shall not be canceled, modified or not renewed (A) by reason of
nonpayment of premium except upon not less than 10 days’ prior written notice
thereof by the insurer to the Administrative Agent (giving the Administrative
Agent the right to cure defaults in the payment of premiums) or (B) for any
other reason except upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice thereof
by the insurer to the Administrative Agent. Each Loan Party shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent a copy of a certificate of insurance evidencing the
required coverage on or prior to the Closing Date and promptly following each
renewal or replacement of such policies thereafter. The Parent Borrower will
furnish to the Lenders, upon request of the Administrative Agent, information
in reasonable detail as to the insurance so maintained.

  

SECTION 5.08. Books and Records; Inspection Rights. Each of Holdings and the
Parent Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep proper
books of record and account in accordance with GAAP. Each of Holdings and the
Parent Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit any
representatives designated by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, upon
reasonable prior notice and without disruption of the normal and ordinary
conduct of the business of Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any such
Subsidiary, to visit and inspect its properties, to examine and make extracts
from its books and records, and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition
with its officers and, if an executive officer or a Financial Officer of the
Parent Borrower has been afforded an opportunity to be present, independent
accountants (subject to such accountants’ customary policies and procedures),
all at such reasonable times during normal business hours and as often as
reasonably requested. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
5.08, none of Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary will be required
to disclose, permit the inspection, examination or making copies or abstracts
of, or discussion of, any document, information or other matter that (a) in
respect of

  

97

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

which disclosure to the Administrative Agent or any Lender (or their
respective representatives or contractors) is prohibited by law or any bona
fide arm’s length third party contract or (b) is subject to attorney-client or
similar privilege or constitutes attorney work product; provided that each of
Holdings and the Parent Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, make available redacted versions of requested documents or, if unable to
do so consistent with the preservation of such privilege, shall endeavor in
good faith otherwise to disclose information responsive to the requests of the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Related Parties,
in a manner that will protect such privilege.

  

SECTION 5.09. Compliance with Laws. Each of Holdings and the Parent Borrower
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its
property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate,
would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

  

SECTION 5.10. Use of Proceeds and Letters of Credit. The proceeds of the Term
Loans shall be used only to repay the Indebtedness and other obligations under
the Existing ABL Credit Agreement, and to pay costs, expenses and fees in
connection with the Transactions. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans may only
be used (a) to repay the Indebtedness under the Existing ABL Credit Agreement
to the extent that the proceeds of the Term Loans made on the Closing Date are
not sufficient to fully repay such Indebtedness, (b) to pay costs, expenses
and fees in connection with the Transactions and the credit facility under
this Agreement, and (c) for working capital and general corporate purposes of
Borrowers (including capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions). No part
of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether directly or indirectly, for
any purpose that entails a violation of any of the Regulations of the Board,
including Regulations T, U and X. Letters of Credit will be issued to support
obligations of the Account Parties in respect of purchases of inventory in the
ordinary course of business, as well as other obligations of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries incurred without violation of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 5.11.Additional Guarantee Parties. If any Subsidiary (other than any
Foreign Subsidiary or any Subsidiary, substantially all of the assets of which
consist of Equity Interests in one or more Foreign Subsidiaries) becomes a
Material Subsidiary or otherwise becomes a Guarantee Party after the Closing
Date, Holdings and the Parent Borrower shall, within fifteen Business Days
after such Subsidiary becomes a Material Subsidiary or a Guarantee Party (as
applicable), notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereof and cause
the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement to be satisfied with respect to such
Subsidiary.

  

SECTION 5.12. Further Assurances. Each of Holdings and the Parent Borrower
will, and will cause each Guarantee Party and each Additional Grantor to,
execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and
instruments, and take all such further actions, which may be required under
any applicable law, or which the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
may reasonably request, to cause the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement to
be and remain satisfied, all at the expense of the Guarantee Parties and the
Additional Grantors. Holdings and the Parent Borrower also agree to provide to
the Administrative Agent, from time to time upon reasonable request, evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as to the perfection and
priority of the Liens created or intended to be created by the Security
Documents.

  

SECTION 5.13. Maintenance of Ratings. Holdings will use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain continuously in effect (i) a Credit Rating from
each of Moody’s and S&P in respect of Holdings and (ii) a credit rating of
this facility from each of Moody’s and S&P.

  

SECTION 5.14. Appraisals. Once in each twelve month period (unless the Parent
Borrower otherwise requests that additional appraisals of Inventory be
conducted in the relevant twelve month period, as provided below), so long as
Adjusted Excess Availability is not less than 40% of the

  

98

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Revolving Credit Line Cap, or no Specified Event of Default exists, at the
request of the Administrative Agent or a Co-Collateral Agent, the Loan Parties
will permit the Administrative Agent to conduct, and the Administrative Agent
shall conduct, one appraisal or update thereof of their Inventory by an
appraiser selected and engaged by the Administrative Agent, and prepared on a
basis satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, such appraisal or update to
include, without limitation, information required by applicable law and
regulations; provided that (a) if a Specified Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, there shall be no limitation on the number of such
appraisals that Administrative Agent may conduct at the expense of Borrowers,
(b) if Adjusted Excess Availability is less than 40% of the Revolving Credit
Line Cap during such twelve month period, upon the request of Administrative
Agent or a Co-Collateral Agent, the Loan Parties will permit the
Administrative Agent to conduct, and Administrative Agent may conduct, 2
appraisals by such appraiser during such twelve month period at the expense of
Borrowers, and (c) the Loan Parties will permit such other appraisals as
Administrative Agent or Co-Collateral Agents may request at any time at their
own expense. In addition to the foregoing, the Parent Borrower may request in
writing that the Administrative Agent conduct additional appraisals of
Inventory from time to time in order to effect a change in the Net Recovery
Percentage of any of the Eligible Inventory or to evaluate and appraise any
Additional Inventory (and such appraisals shall not be considered for purposes
of any limitation on appraisals provided for herein). For purposes of this
Section 5.14, it is understood and agreed that a single appraisal may consist
of examinations conducted at multiple relevant sites and involve one or more
relevant Loan Parties and their assets. All such appraisals shall be commenced
upon reasonable notice to the Parent Borrower and performed during normal
business hours of the Parent Borrower, and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
of such appraisals shall be at the sole expense of the Parent Borrower, except
for appraisals conducted pursuant to clause (c) above.

  

SECTION 5.15. Field Examinations. Once in each twelve month period, so long as
Adjusted Excess Availability is not less than 40% of the Revolving Credit Line
Cap, or no Specified Event of Default exists, at the request of the
Administrative Agent or a Co-Collateral Agent, the Loan Parties will permit
the Administrative Agent, the Co-Collateral Agents or professionals engaged by
Administrative Agent or the Co-Collateral Agents to conduct, and the
Administrative Agent, Co-Collateral Agents or such professionals shall
conduct, one field examination of (a) the books and records relating to the
accounts of the Loan Parties and (b) the inventory of the Loan Parties, in
each case to ensure the adequacy of the Collateral included in the Borrowing
Base and related reporting and control systems; provided that (i) if a
Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, there shall be no
limitation on the number or frequency of field examinations that the
Administrative Agent, Co-Collateral Agents or such professionals may conduct
at the expense of Borrowers, (ii) if Adjusted Excess Availability is less than
40% of the Revolving Credit Line Cap during such twelve month period,
Administrative Agent, the Co-Collateral Agents or professionals engaged by
them may conduct 2 field examinations during such twelve month period at the
expense of Borrowers, and (iii) Administrative Agent, the Co-Collateral Agents
or professionals engaged by them may conduct such other field examinations any
time at their own expense. For purposes of this Section 5.15, it is understood
and agreed that a single field examination may be conducted at multiple
relevant sites and involve one or more relevant Loan Parties and their assets.
All such field examinations shall be commenced upon reasonable advance notice
to the Parent Borrower and performed during normal business hours of the
Parent Borrower, and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs of such field
examinations shall be at the sole expense of the Parent Borrower except for
field examinations conducted pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 5.15.

  

SECTION 5.16. Cash Management; Control Agreements.

  

(a)After the Closing Date, the Loan Parties, promptly upon the request of the
Administrative Agent, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a schedule of
all Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts that are maintained by the Loan
Parties, which Schedule shall include, with respect to

  

  

99

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

each depository, (i) the name and address of such depository, (ii) the account
number(s) maintained with such depository, and (iii) a contact person at such
depository.

  

(b)Within 120 days after the Closing Date (or such later date as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably agree in its sole discretion), each Loan
Party shall have entered into a Control Agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, with (i) the bank which
maintains Parent Borrower’s main concentration account (the “Concentration
Account”), (ii) the bank which maintains each Specified Demand Account, and
(iii) each bank with which each Loan Party maintains each of the Deposit
Accounts described on Schedule 5.16 (the Concentration Account and each other
account at any time subject to a Control Agreement, a “Control Account”) and
shall at all times thereafter cause all such accounts to be maintained as
Control Accounts, provided, that, Loan Parties shall not be required to enter
into a Control Agreement with respect to (A) Deposit Accounts used exclusively
in connection with any retail store or stores, (B) Excluded Accounts or (C)
except as provided in clause (d) below, any Securities Account. Unless the
Administrative Agent has given contrary instructions to the applicable bank or
financial institution pursuant to the applicable Control Agreement, the Loan
Parties shall cause all proceeds of Collateral received in Deposit Accounts
used by its retail stores that are not Control Accounts, and all other amounts
otherwise constituting or received in respect of proceeds of Collateral
received in Control Accounts other than the Concentration Account, in each
case to be transferred each Business Day (or with such other frequency as
Administrative Agent may agree) to the Concentration Account; provided that
this sentence shall not apply to any Excluded Accounts or Specified Demand
Accounts. Each Loan Party shall direct all credit card issuers and processors
that are obligated to make payments to such Loan Party, and those customers
making payments on Accounts and other payments on Collateral to make daily
transfers of the payments due from such issuer, processor or other Person to a
Control Account.

  

(c)Subject to the time periods specified in Section 5.16(b), unless the
Administrative Agent has given contrary instructions to the applicable bank or
financial institution pursuant to the applicable Control Agreement, the Loan
Parties shall cause the wire transfer on each Business Day (whether or not
there are at the time outstanding Loans) of all available cash receipts to the
Concentration Account, from:

  

(i)the sale of Inventory;

  

(ii)all proceeds of collections of Accounts (including in respect of credit
card receivables, whether or not constituting Eligible Credit Card
Receivables); and

  

(iii)each Control Account (including all cash deposited therein), other than
any Specified Demand Account.

  

(d)Loan Parties shall at all times, maintain not less than 40% of the
aggregate amount of “cash short-term investments” (as such term is used in the
balance sheet of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries and consistent
with the current practices of Holdings as of the date hereof) in the Specified
Demand Accounts identified in writing to Administrative Agent, provided, that,
such “cash short-term investments” may inadvertently be less than 40% of the
aggregate amount thereof for up to 10 Business Days, but in no event for any
reason for any period less than 20% of the aggregate amount thereof. The
amounts of such “cash short-term investments” shall be reported to
Administrative Agent with the delivery of each Borrowing Base Certificate and
upon request of Administrative Agent.

  

(e)At any time that Excess Availability shall have been less than 40% of the
Revolving Credit Line Cap for 2 consecutive Business Days, each Loan Party
shall reasonably promptly transfer all funds in any Securities Accounts or
Deposit Accounts that are not subject to a Control Agreement (other

  

100

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

than (i) Excluded Accounts, (ii) Deposit Accounts used exclusively in
connection with any retail store or stores and (iii) Deposit Accounts or
Securities Accounts containing solely the identifiable cash proceeds of
property that was Term Loan Exclusive Collateral when such cash proceeds
arose) to a Specified Demand Account, provided, that, at any time thereafter
Loan Parties shall not be required to transfer such funds if Excess
Availability shall have been equal to or greater than 40% of the Revolving
Credit Line Cap for at least 30 consecutive calendar days (until such time as
Excess Availability may again be less than such amount for 2 consecutive
Business Days).

  

(f)If on any date (i) Excess Availability shall be less than 25% of the
Revolving Credit Line Cap or (ii) the Revolving Credit Exposure (not including
any LC Exposure) shall exceed 50% of the Revolving Credit Line Cap, then (A)
each Loan Party shall promptly enter into an amendment to the Collateral
Agreement satisfactory to the Administrative Agent pursuant to which such Loan
Party shall, for the benefit of the Secured Parties grant a Lien on all its
Securities Accounts which prior to such amendment shall have been excluded
from the Lien of the Collateral Agreement (other than any Securities Account
containing solely the identifiable cash proceeds of property that was Term
Loan Exclusive Collateral when such cash proceeds arose) and (B) the Loan
Parties shall within 30 days after such date (or such later date as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably agree in its sole discretion) enter into
Control Agreements, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, with the applicable securities intermediaries in respect
of such Securities Accounts as shall be required so that after giving effect
thereto all cash or cash equivalents owned by the Loan Parties (other than (i)
amounts contained in Excluded Accounts, (ii) amounts in any Deposit Accounts
used exclusively in connection with any retail store or stores and (iii) any
Deposit Account or Securities Account containing solely the identifiable cash
proceeds of property that was Term Loan Exclusive Collateral when such cash
proceeds arose) shall be held in Control Accounts and shall at all times
thereafter cause all such accounts to be maintained as Control Accounts.

  

(g)The Loan Parties may close Deposit Accounts, Securities Accounts or Control
Accounts and/or open new Deposit Accounts, Securities Accounts or Control
Accounts, subject to the execution and delivery to the Administrative Agent of
appropriate Control Agreements to the extent required by the provisions of
this Section 5.16 and any such required Control Agreements shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Loan Parties shall furnish the
Administrative Agent with prior written notice of their intention to open or
close a Control Account.

  

(h)Each of Holdings and the Parent Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees on
behalf of itself and each other Loan Party that (i) the funds on deposit in
the Concentration Account, all other Control Accounts and, subject to clause
(f) above, all Securities Accounts shall at all times continue to be
collateral security for all of the Obligations and (ii) during a Cash Dominion
Period, such Loan Party shall have no right of withdrawal from the
Concentration Account and the funds on deposit in the Concentration Account
(and any other Control Account or Securities Account that are not being
transferred to the Concentration Account) shall be transferred to the
Revolving Agent Payment Account for application to the Obligations as provided
in this Agreement and the Collateral Agreement (except for (i) amounts
permitted to be held as Permitted Investments pursuant to Section 6.04(a),
(ii) proceeds of assets, other than ABL Priority Collateral, subject to Liens
permitted under Section 6.02, to the extent such proceeds are required to be
applied to the payment of the applicable obligations secured thereby and (iii)
amounts contained in Deposit Accounts or Securities Accounts containing solely
the identifiable cash proceeds of property that was Term Loan Exclusive
Collateral when such cash proceeds arose). In the event that any Loan Party
receives or otherwise has dominion and control of any such proceeds or
collections in contravention of the provisions of this Section 5.16, such
proceeds and collections shall be held in trust by such Loan Party for the
Administrative Agent, shall not be commingled with any of such Loan Party’s
other funds or deposited in any account of such Loan Party and shall promptly
be deposited

  

101

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

into the Concentration Account or dealt with in such other fashion as such
Loan Party may be instructed by the Administrative Agent.

  

(i)Any amounts received in the Concentration Account at any time when all of
the Obligations then due have been and remain fully repaid (and all deposits
required to be made pursuant to Section 2.09(g) or 2.17(h) shall have been
made) shall, upon the request of Parent Borrower and subject to applicable
law, be remitted to the operating account of the Parent Borrower maintained
with the Administrative Agent.

  

(j)The Administrative Agent shall give any notice of exclusive control or
similar notice for any Control Account at such time as a Cash Dominion Period
has occurred and is continuing. The Administrative Agent shall not give any
notice of exclusive control or similar notice for any Control Account unless a
Cash Dominion Period has occurred and is continuing. Upon the written request
of Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly (but in any event
within five Business Days) furnish written notice to each Person with whom a
Control Account is maintained of any termination of a Cash Dominion Period.

  

SECTION 5.17. Environmental Laws. Except for the Disclosed Matters and except
with respect to any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
result in a Material Adverse Effect, each of Holdings and the Parent Borrower
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (a) conduct its operations
and keep and maintain its real property in material compliance with all
Environmental Laws; and (b) obtain and renew all environmental permits
necessary for its operations and properties.

  

SECTION 5.18. Lender Meetings. Within sixty (60) days after the receipt by
Administrative Agent of the audited financial statements pursuant to Section
5.01(a) for the then most recently ended fiscal year of Holdings or on such
other date as Administrative Agent and Parent Borrower may agree, at the
request of Administrative Agent or of the Required Revolving Lenders and upon
reasonable prior notice, (a) at the request of Revolving Agent or of the
Required Revolving Lenders, Borrowers will hold one meeting (at a mutually
agreeable location and time or, at the option of Administrative Agent, by
conference call) with all Revolving Lenders who choose to attend such meeting
and (b) at the request of Term Agent or of the Required Term Lenders,
Borrowers will hold one meeting (at a mutually agreeable location and time or,
at the option of Administrative Agent, by conference call) with all Term
Lenders who choose to attend such meeting, in each case at which meeting the
financial results of the previous fiscal year shall be reviewed.

action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the

responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate,

received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,

obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any

Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of any Loan Party. Each Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing, and shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that such Agent is required to

taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

  

SECTION 8.07. Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly

fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that
no act by Administrative Agent or any Co-Collateral Agent hereafter taken,
including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan
Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by
Administrative Agent or any Co-Collateral Agent to any Lender. Each Lender
represents to Administrative Agent and the Co-Collateral Agents that it has,
independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent, any Co-
Collateral Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates and
made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon Administrative Agent, any Co-Collateral Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals
and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to
inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by Administrative Agent or the Co-Collateral Agents
hereunder, Administrative Agent and the Co-Collateral Agents shall not have
any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition
(financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or
any affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of
Administrative Agent or any Co-Collateral Agent or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

  

SECTION 8.08. Reports and Financial Statements. By signing this Agreement,
each Lender:

promptly after they become available, copies of all financial statements
required to be delivered by the Loan Parties hereunder and all Reports (which
the Administrative Agent and the Co-Collateral Agents agree to so deliver);

  

(b)expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Administrative Agent and the Co-
Collateral Agents make no representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as

any information contained in any financial statement or Report;

  

(c)expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not comprehensive
audits or examinations, that the Administrative Agent, the Co-Collateral
Agents or any other party performing any audit or examination will inspect
only specific information regarding the Loan Parties and will rely
significantly upon the Loan Parties' books and records, as well as on
representations of the Loan Parties' personnel and that the Administrative
Agent and Co-Collateral Agents undertake no obligation to update, correct or
supplement the Reports;

  

119

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

  

  

(d)agrees to keep all Reports confidential in accordance with the requirements
of Section 9.12 and strictly for its internal use, not share the Report with
any Loan Party or any other Person, except as otherwise permitted pursuant to
this Agreement; and

  

(e)without limiting the generality of any other indemnification provision
contained in this Agreement, agrees: (i) to hold the Administrative Agent and
the Co-Collateral Agents and any such other Lender preparing a Report harmless
from any action the indemnifying Lender may take or conclusion the
indemnifying Lender may reach or draw from any Report in connection with any
credit extensions that the indemnifying Lender has made or may make to the
Borrowers, or the indemnifying Lender's participation in any Letter of Credit
or Swingline Loans, or the indemnifying Lender's purchase of, a Loan or Loans;
and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend, and hold Administrative
Agent, the Co-Collateral Agents and any such other Lender preparing a Report
harmless from and against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs,
expenses, and other amounts (including reasonable attorney costs) incurred by
Administrative Agent, Co-Collateral Agents and any such other Lender preparing
a Report as the direct or indirect result of any third parties who might
obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.

  

SECTION 8.09. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify Administrative
Agent, each Co- Collateral Agent, Revolving Agent and Term Agent in its
capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by Holdings or the Borrowers
and without limiting the obligation of Holdings or the Borrowers to do so),
ratably according to their respective Applicable Percentages in effect on the
date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if
indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Revolving Commitments
of any Lender shall have terminated and the Revolving Loans and the Term Loans
shall have been paid in full, in accordance with such Applicable Percentages
immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether
before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the
Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender
shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and non-appealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such
Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section
shall survive the payment of the Obligations and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

  

SECTION 8.10. Successor Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a
successor Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, Term Agent or Co-Collateral
Agent, as applicable, as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent,
Revolving Agent, Term Agent or any Co-Collateral Agent may resign as
Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, Term Agent or Co-Collateral Agent, as
applicable, upon 30 days’ notice to Lenders, each Issuing Bank and Parent
Borrower. Upon receipt of a request for resignation from the Administrative
Agent, Term Agent, Revolving Agent, or a Co-Collateral Agent, as applicable,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint from among the Lenders a
successor agent or co-collateral agent for the Lenders, which successor agent
shall (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) be
subject to approval by Parent Borrower (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no such successor shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks,
appoint a successor agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York,

appointment as a successor agent, such successor agent shall succeed to the

“Administrative Agent”, “Revolving Agent”, “Term Agent” or “Co-Collateral
Agent” , as applicable, shall mean such successor agent effective upon such
appointment and approval, and the former Agent’s rights, powers and duties as
Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, Term Agent or Co-Collateral Agent, as
applicable, shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on
the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Advances. The fees payable by the Parent Borrower to a
successor Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, Term Agent or Co-Collateral
Agent, as applicable, shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Parent Borrower and such successor agent.
After any retiring Agent’s resignation as such Agent, the provisions of this
Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was such Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

  

SECTION 8.11. Co-Collateral Agent Determinations.

  

(a) In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Co-Collateral Agents
cannot agree on any matter relating to the Borrowing Base, Excess
Availability, Borrowing Base eligibility standards, Reserves, advance rates,
Borrowing Base reporting, Collateral appraisals or examinations, the
determination shall be made by the Administrative Agent or the Co-Collateral
Agent either asserting the more conservative credit judgment (that is, that
would result in the least amount of credit being available to the Borrowers
under this Agreement) or declining to permit the requested action, which

expressly prescribed in this Agreement for such matter.

  

(b)The Administrative Agent agrees to provide each Co-Collateral Agent with
drafts of Collateral appraisals and field examination reports and final
versions of appraisals and field examination reports promptly after the
Administrative Agent’s receipt thereof (but the Administrative Agent shall not
be liable for failing to do so). The Co-Collateral Agents will have the right
to participate in all decisions relating to the settling of the scope of field
examinations and appraisals, and to participate in any such audit or appraisal
at their own expense, and, subject to the limits on the frequency thereof
provided for in this Agreement, the right to request and determine the timing
of field examinations, collateral appraisals and other examinations, in each
case in the exercise of their respective Permitted Discretion. Each party
hereto hereby agrees that nothing contained herein shall permit any Co-
Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) to establish, modify, or release
any Reserves or undertake to order or conduct any appraisals, field
examinations or other examinations of any Collateral or the business of the
Loan Parties or take any other action, but rather this Agreement grants each
Co-Collateral Agent the right and authority to direct the Administrative Agent
to do so in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other
Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release
or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender or an
Issuing Bank and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the
Loan Documents. In no event shall Administrative Agent or any Co-Collateral
Agent be required to verify the amount of or any payment of, or the terms of
any other arrangements, with respect to Secured Swap Obligations, Secured
Treasury Services Obligations, or Secured Supply Chain Obligations or have any
liability in connection with the establishment of any Reserves with respect

providing Secured Swap Obligations, Secured Treasury Services Obligations, or
Secured Supply Chain Obligations authorizes and consents to the disclosure of
any information concerning such Secured Swap Obligations, Secured Treasury
Services Obligations, or Secured Supply Chain Obligations to any Agent or
other Lender at any time and from time to time, provided, that, in no event
shall such disclosure be deemed a representation or warranty by Administrative
Agent of the accuracy or completeness of such information.

  

SECTION 8.15. Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or any other
judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party,

  

(a)the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan

Agent shall have made any demand on the Loan Parties) shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

other Secured Parties, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation,

  

  

122

expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its
agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent.

Issuing Bank or other Secured Party any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any

123

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

  

(a)No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Term Agent, any Co-
Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the
Term Agent, the Co-Collateral Agents, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver
of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan
Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan
or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Term Agent, any
Co-Collateral Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or
knowledge of such Default at the time.

  

(b)Except as expressly contemplated by Section 2.05(i), 2.22 or 2.23 (which
amendments shall be permitted if entered into by the parties referred to
therein, but subject to Section 9.02(b)(iv) below), neither this Agreement nor
any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived,
amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Holdings, the Borrowers,
the Account Parties, the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Term
Agent, or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or
agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent, the Term
Agent, and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each
case with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement
shall

  

(i)increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such
Lender,

  

(ii)reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the
rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the
written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; provided that (A)
only the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders shall be necessary to amend
the provisions of Section 2.12(c) providing for the default rate of interest
as to any Revolving Loans or unreimbursed LC Disbursements, or to waive any
obligations of any Borrower or any Account Party to pay interest at such
default rate and (B) only the consent of the Required Term Lenders shall be
necessary to amend the provisions of Section 2.12(c) providing for the default
rate of interest as to any Term Loans, or to waive any obligations of any
Borrower or any Account Party to pay interest at such default rate,

  

(iii)postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any
Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or
postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, or postpone or
reduce the amount of, or waive or excuse any mandatory prepayment under
Section 2.10(c) or Section 2.10(d), in each case without the written consent
of each Lender directly affected thereby; provided that (A) only the consent
of the Required Revolving Lenders shall be necessary to amend the provisions
of Section 2.12(c) providing for the default rate of interest as to any
Revolving Loans or unreimbursed LC Disbursements, or to waive any obligations
of any Borrower or any Account Party to pay interest at such default rate and
(B) only the consent of the Required Term Lenders shall be necessary to amend
the provisions of Section 2.12(c) providing for the default rate of interest
as to any Term Loans, or to waive any obligations of any Borrower or any
Account Party to pay interest at such default rate and (C) any amendment to
Section 2.10(e) or any other change to any repayment of the Term

  

124

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Loans from any Consolidated Excess Cash Flow may be waived or modified solely
with the written consent of the Required Term Lenders,

  

(iv)change the order of application of funds provided in Section 2.09(g) and
2.17(h), or the provisions in Sections 2.22, 2.23 and 9.02(e) with respect to
the order of application of funds, without the consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby;

  

(v)change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata
sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each
Lender,

“Required Lenders”, each Revolving Lender in the case of the definition of
“Required Revolving Lenders”, each Lender in the case of “Supermajority
Lenders” and each Term Lender in the case of the definition of “Required Term

Collateral Agreement (except as expressly provided in the Collateral
Agreement) without the written consent of each Lender;

  

(x)change Section 2.05(k)(i) in a manner that would alter the participation
obligation of any Lender, without the written consent of such Lender;

  

(xi)permit any Loan Party to assign its rights under the Loan Documents,
without the written consent of each Lender;

  

(xii)increase the percentages applied to eligible assets in the definition of
the Borrowing Base, without the consent of each Lender;



(xiii)except as otherwise provided in clause (xii) above as to an increase in
such percentages, change the definition of the term “Borrowing Base” or any
component definition thereof if as a result thereof the amounts available to
be borrowed by the Borrowers would be increased, without the written consent
of Supermajority Lenders and Required Term Lenders, provided, that, (A) the
foregoing shall not limit the discretion of the Co-Collateral Agents to
change, establish or eliminate any Reserves, and (B) in no event shall the
amount of the Term Loan Reserve be reduced below the principal amount of the
Term Loans without the written consent of each Term Lender;

  

(xiv)except as expressly permitted herein or in any other Loan Document,
subordinate the Obligations hereunder or the Liens granted hereunder or under
the other Loan

  

125

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Documents, to any other Indebtedness or Lien, as the case may be without the
written consent of each Lender; and

  

(xv)amend, modify or waive any terms of Section 8.11 hereof, or amend the
definition of “Co-Collateral Agents”, in each case without the consent of each
of the Co-Collateral Agents;

and, provided, that, (1) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the applicable Issuing Bank in addition to the Lenders
required above, affect the rights or duties of such Issuing Bank under this
Agreement or any Issuer Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to
be issued by it; (2) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing
and signed by the Swingline Lender in addition to the Lenders required above,
affect the rights or duties of the Swingline Lender under this Agreement; (3)
no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent or Term Agent, as applicable, in addition to the Lenders
required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or
Term Agent, as applicable, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
(4) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
affected Co-Collateral Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect
any rights, duties or discretion of such affected Co-Collateral Agent under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and (5) any fee letters may be
amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only
by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Revolving Commitment of such
Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, no provider or holder of any Secured Swap Obligations, Secured
Treasury Services Obligations, or Secured Supply Chain Obligations shall have
any voting or approval rights hereunder (or be deemed a Lender) solely by
virtue of its status as the provider or holder of such agreements or products
or the Obligations owing thereunder, nor shall the consent of any such
provider or holder be required (other than in their capacities as Lenders, to
the extent applicable) for any matter hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents, including as to any matter relating to the Collateral or the
release of Collateral or any Loan Party.

  

(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the consent of the Required Lenders
shall not be required to amend this Agreement to increase the total
Commitments pursuant to Section 2.22 and to make other changes incidental
thereto or contemplated thereby and (ii) this Agreement may be amended by an
agreement in writing entered into by the Parent Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Term Agent to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency; provided that, in the case of clause (ii), the Lenders shall
have received at least five Business Days’ prior written notice thereof and
the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of
the date of such notice to the Lenders, written notice from the Required
Lenders to the effect that the Required Lenders object to such amendment.

  

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (but subject to Section
9.02(b)(iv) to the extent provided therein), this Agreement may be amended (or
deemed amended) or amended and restated, in whole or in part, with the written
consent of the Required Revolving Lenders and the Required Term Lenders, the
Administrative Agent, the Term Agent and the Parent Borrower to (i) add one or
more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the
extensions of credit from time to time outstanding hereunder and the accrued
interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the existing facilities and the
accrued interest and fees in respect thereof, (ii) to include, as appropriate,
Lenders holding such credit facilities in any required

  

  

126

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

vote or action of the Required Lenders, Required Revolving Lenders, Required
Term Lenders or of the Lenders of each facility under this Agreement and (iii)
to provide class protection for any additional credit facilities in a manner
consistent with those provided the original facilities pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement originally in effect. Any payments in respect of
obligations under such additional credit facilities shall only be applied to
such obligations either pari passu with, or after the payment in full of, the
principal of the Term Loans pursuant to the priority of application of
payments set forth in this Agreement.

  

(f)If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination of or to any of the provision of this Agreement and/or any other
Loan Document requiring the consent of “each Lender” or “each Lender directly
affected thereby”, the consent of the Required Lenders, Required Revolving
Lenders or Required Term Lenders, as the case may be, is obtained, but the
consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose
consent is necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a “Non-
Consenting Lender”), then the Parent Borrower may, upon prior written notice
to the Administrative Agent and the Non-Consenting Lender, elect to replace
such Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement; provided that,
concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity shall
agree, as of such date, to purchase (and the Non-Consenting Lender shall be
obligated to sell) for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-
Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a
Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of
the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with
the requirements of Section 9.04(b) (provided that each such bank or other
entity, if not already a Lender (or an Affiliate of a Lender) hereunder, shall
be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably
withheld)), (ii) the replacement Lender shall pay the processing and
recordation fee referred to in Section 9.04(b)(ii)(C), if applicable, in
accordance with the terms of such Section, (iii) the replacement Lender shall
grant its consent with respect to the applicable proposed change, waiver,
discharge or termination and (iv) the replacement Lender shall pay to such
Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (1) all
principal, interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such
Non-Consenting Lender by the Borrowers and the Account Parties hereunder to
and including the date of termination, including, without limitation, payments
due to such Non-Consenting Lender under Sections 2.14 and 2.16, and (2) an
amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Non-
Consenting Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.15 had the
Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold
to the replacement Lender. In connection with any such replacement, if the
Non-Consenting Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent
a duly completed Assignment and Assumption and/or any other documentation
necessary to reflect such replacement by the later of (a) the date on which
the replacement Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption
and/or such other documentation and (b) the date as of which all obligations
of the Borrowers and the Account Parties owing to the Non-Consenting Lender
relating to the loans and participations so assigned shall be paid in full by
the replacement Lender to such Non-Consenting Lender, then such Non-Consenting
Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and
Assumption and/or such other documentation as of such date and the applicable
Borrowers and/or Account Parties shall be entitled (but not obligated) to
execute and deliver such Assignment and Assumption and/or such other
documentation on behalf of such Non- Consenting Lender.

  

SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses and

127

other Loan Documents and the financing arrangements set forth herein or
therein, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses
(provided, that, such legal fees and expenses shall be limited to the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and disbursements of two legal
counsels for Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, Term Agent, each Co-
Collateral Agent, Swingline Lender, each Issuing Bank, each Lender and Lead
Arrangers, taken as a whole, and in addition, one local or special counsel in
each applicable jurisdiction for such Persons, taken as a whole, and in the
case of an actual conflict of interest where the party affected by such
conflict informs Parent Borrower of such conflict and thereafter retains its
own counsel, one counsel for such affected person), provided, that, Lead
Arrangers shall only be reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with
the syndication of the credit facility under this Agreement, (ii) all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by each Issuing Bank
in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter

Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender limited to the reasonable
legal fees and expenses of the counsels set forth above, in connection with
the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan
Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the
Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring

by the Administrative Agent relating thereto). This Section 9.03(a) shall not
apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses or
damages arising from any non-Tax claim.



(b)To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Parent Borrower and each
other Loan Party (each, an “Indemnifying Party” and collectively,
“Indemnifying Parties”) agrees that it will indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, Term Agent, each Co-Collateral
Agent, each Issuing Bank, each Lead Arranger and each Lender and each of their
affiliates and controlling persons and the respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns of the foregoing
(each, an “Indemnified Party”, and collectively, “Indemnified Parties”) from

or investigation (whether or not in connection with litigation in which any of
the Indemnified Parties is a party) and including, without limitation, any and
all claims, damages, obligations, penalties, judgments, awards, and
liabilities, reasonable and documented out-of- pocket costs, expenses and
disbursements, resulting from any act or omission of any of the Indemnified
Parties), directly or indirectly, caused by, relating to, based upon, arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Existing ABL Credit
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated
herein or therein or the actual or proposed use of the Letters of Credit or
the proceeds of the Advances regardless of whether any such Indemnified Party
is a party thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a
third party or by any Indemnifying Party or any of its affiliates or equity
holders) (provided, that, the obligations to reimburse any Indemnified Party
for legal fees and expenses shall be limited to the reasonable legal fees and
expenses of one firm of counsel for all such Indemnified Parties taken as a
whole, and in the case of an actual conflict of interest where the Indemnified
Party

affected by such conflict informs Parent Borrower of such conflict and
thereafter retains its own counsel), one counsel for such affected Indemnified
Party); provided, that, such indemnity agreement shall not, as to any
Indemnified Party, apply to (i) losses, claims, damages, obligations,
penalties, judgments, awards, liabilities, costs, expenses, disbursements,
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations that do not involve an act or
omission of any Indemnifying Party or any of any Indemnifying Party’s
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives or
affiliates and that are solely between or among the Indemnified Parties or
solely between or among Indemnified Parties and their respective Related
Parties (other than claims brought against an Indemnified Party in its
capacity as an arranger, bookrunner, agent or similar role in connection with
this Agreement), (ii) any portion of any such loss, claim, damage, obligation,
penalty, judgment, award, liability, cost, expense or disbursement of an
Indemnified Party, or action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving an
Indemnified Party, to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction determines
pursuant to a final non-appealable judgment that such loss, claim, damage,
obligation, penalty, judgment, award, liability, cost, expense or disbursement
of an Indemnified Party, or action, suit, proceeding or investigation to have
resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Party or any of such Indemnified Party’s Related Parties, (iii)
losses, claims, damages, obligations, penalties, judgments, awards,
liabilities, costs, expenses, disbursements, actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations that arise from any material breach by such Indemnified Party
or its Related Parties of its obligations under this Agreement as determined
by the final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or
(iv) any settlement entered into by any Indemnified Party or any of its
Related Parties without the prior written consent of Parent Borrower (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). This Section 9.03(b)
shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent
losses or damages arising from any non-Tax claim. To the extent that the
Parent Borrower or any other Account Party fails to pay any amount required to
be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, Term Agent, each
Co-Collateral Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender under paragraph (a) or
(b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the applicable
Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or the applicable Swingline Lender, as the
case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time
that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of
such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified
loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was
incurred by or asserted against the applicable Agent, any Co-Collateral Agent,
the applicable Issuing Bank or the applicable Swingline Lender in its capacity
as such.

  

(c)If any action, suit, proceeding or investigation is commenced, as to which
any Indemnified Party proposes to demand indemnification, it shall notify the
Indemnifying Party with reasonable promptness; provided, that, any failure by
any of the Indemnified Parties to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligations hereunder to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof.
The Indemnified Parties, shall have the right to retain one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties taken as a whole (and in the case of an actual
conflict of interest where the Indemnified Party affected by such conflict
informs the Parent Borrower of such conflict and thereafter retains its own
counsel, one counsel for such affected Indemnified Party), in each case, of
its choice to represent the Indemnified Parties, and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, expenses, and
disbursement of such counsel to the extent required under the immediately
preceding paragraph, and such counsel shall, to the extent consistent with its
professional responsibilities, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and any
counsel designated by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Parties shall
be liable for any settlement of any claim against any of the Indemnified
Parties, to the extent such claim is required to be indemnified by any such
Indemnifying Party pursuant to the terms of this Section 9.03 (an “Indemnified
Claim”) and is made with any Indemnifying Party’s prior written consent (not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Without the prior written consent of
the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Agent and the Term Agent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), an Indemnifying Party shall not settle or
compromise any Indemnified Claim, permit a default or consent to the entry of
any judgment in

  

129

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

respect thereof, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release
of such Indemnified Party in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Party from all liability or claims that are the subject
matter of such proceedings and (ii) does not include any statement as to or
any admission of fault, culpability, wrongdoing or a failure to act by or on
behalf of any Indemnified Party.

  

(d)No Indemnified Party, Indemnifying Party or other party hereto shall be
liable for any damages arising from the use by others of materials obtained
through internet, Intralinks, SyndTrak or other similar transmission systems
in connection with this Agreement and the financing arrangements contemplated
hereby, except to the extent any such damages arise from the gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party or any of such
Indemnified Party’s Related Parties as determined pursuant to a final, non-
appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, none of
the Indemnified Parties or any Loan Party or any of its or their respective
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, members or
representatives shall be responsible or liable for special, indirect,
consequential, exemplary, incidental or punitive damages which may be alleged
as a result of this Agreement, provided that nothing contained in this
sentence shall limit any Loan Party’s indemnity and reimbursement obligations
as set forth herein (including the Loan Parties’ indemnity and reimbursement
obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for indirect, special,
punitive or consequential damages that are included in any third party claim
in connection with which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder). It is further agreed that the Loan Parties shall have no liability
to any person other than the Indemnified Parties to the extent set forth
herein, provided that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the Loan
Parties’ indemnity and reimbursement obligations as set forth herein
(including the Loan Parties’ indemnity and reimbursement obligations to
indemnify the Indemnified Parties with respect to any third party claim in
connection with which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder). These indemnification provisions shall be in addition (but without
duplication of) any liability which the Indemnifying Party may have to any of
the Indemnified Parties.

  

(e)All amounts due under clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section shall
be payable promptly upon Administrative Agent’s written demand therefor, but
in any event within ten (10) Business Days after such demand.

  

SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns.

  

(a)The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns

Account Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or

expressly contemplates such assignment or transfer without the prior written
consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by Holdings,
any Borrower or any Account Party without such consent shall be null and void)
and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations
hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby

Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties

and the Loans at the time owing to it); with the prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

(A) (A) the Parent Borrower, provided that no consent of the Parent Borrower

and is continuing, any other assignee and (ii) in the case of an assignment by

the Parent Borrower prior to the Closing Date via a pdf titled “J. C. Penney
Allocations_06.13.14vEXT.pdf”; and

  

(B) the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the Term
Agent), the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank, provided that no consent
of the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the Term
Agent), the Swingline Lender or an Issuing Bank shall be required for an
assignment to an assignee that is a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender
immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.

  

(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following conditions:

  

(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a
Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lender’s Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender
subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative
Agent) shall not be less than $10,000,000 in the case of any Revolving
Commitment and not less than $1,000,000 in the case of any Term Loan, unless
each of the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of
the Term Loans, Parent Borrower and the Term Agent) otherwise consent,
provided that no such consent of the Parent Borrower shall be required if a
Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

  

(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate
part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement;

  

(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the Term Agent) an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500; provided that such fee shall not apply to any assignment made by a

(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the Term Agent) an
Administrative Questionnaire.

  

(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph
(b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of
the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a

  

131

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights
or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section
9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender
of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph
(c) of this Section.

  

(iv) In the case of the Term Loans, the Term Agent acting for this purpose as
an agent of the Borrowers and the Account Parties, shall maintain at one of
its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Term Lenders,
and principal amount of the Term Loans (and the stated interest thereon) owing
to, each Term Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Term
Loan Register”). The entries in the Term Loan Register shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error, and Holdings, the Borrowers, the Account Parties, the
Administrative Agent, the Co-Collateral Agents, the Issuing Banks and the
Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Term Loan
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Term Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Term
Loan Register shall be available for inspection by the Parent Borrower, any
Issuing Bank, any Lender and the Administrative Agent, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

  

(v) In the case of the Revolving Loans, the Revolving Agent, acting for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrowers and the Account Parties, shall maintain
at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it
and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Revolving
Lenders, and the Revolving Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Revolving Loans (and the stated interest thereon) and LC Disbursements owing
to, each Revolving Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
“Revolving Loan Register”). The entries in the Revolving Loan Register shall
be conclusive, absent manifest error, and Holdings, the Borrowers, the Account
Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Co-Collateral Agents, the Issuing Banks
and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Revolving Loan Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Revolving Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Revolving Loan Register shall be available for inspection by the
Parent Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

  

(vi) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed
by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term
Loans, the Term Agent) shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and the
information contained therein shall be recorded in the Term Loan Register or
the Revolving Loan Register, as applicable. No assignment shall be effective
for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Term Loan
Register or Revolving Loan Register, as applicable, as provided in this
paragraph.

  

(vii) In the case of any assignment for which the Parent Borrower’s consent is
not required, the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of the Term Loans, the
Term Agent) shall provide the Parent Borrower with notice promptly upon
receipt of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment.

  

(c)(i) Any Lender may, without the consent of Holdings, any Borrower, any
Account Party, the Administrative Agent, the Term Agent, any Issuing Bank or
any Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other
entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged,

  

  

132

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

(B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
for the performance of such obligations and (C) Holdings, the Borrowers, the
Account Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Term Agent, each Issuing Bank
and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement. For any avoidance of doubt, such Lender shall be responsible for
the indemnity under Section 2.16(d) with respect to any payments made to such
Participant. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such
a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or
instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the
first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that directly affects such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, Holdings, the Borrowers and the
Account Parties agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and
had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided
that such Participant agrees to be subject to Sections 2.17(c) and 2.18 as
though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation, acting solely
for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers and the Account
Parties, shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of
each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement
(the “Participant Register”); provided, however, that no Lender shall have any
obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any
Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating
to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or
its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such
disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of
Credit or other obligation is in “registered form” under Section 5f.103-1(c)
of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender, Holdings,
the Borrowers, the Account Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Banks and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of
this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

  

(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the prior written
consent of the Parent Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
provided that the Participant shall be subject to the provisions of Sections
2.17(c) and 2.18.

  

(d)Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment
of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a
party hereto.

  

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no assignment may be made
or participation sold to no assignment or participation may be made to (i)
natural persons, (ii) any Disqualified Lenders that have been identified to
Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent and Term Agent and whose identity is
available to each Revolving Lender on request, (iii) any Loan Party or (iv)
any of the Affiliates or subsidiaries of Loan Parties. Administrative Agent,
Revolving Agent and Term Agent shall not have any responsibility or obligation
to determine whether any Lender or potential Lender is a Disqualified Lender
and will have no liability with respect to any assignment made to a
Disqualified Lender.

SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any
Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other
party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any
Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or
incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended
hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other
amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid (other than
unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield
protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made) or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding (except to the extent any such Letter of
Credit has had cash collateral or other credit support (satisfactory to the
applicable Issuing Bank(s) in its or their sole discretion) issued therefor
and the Issuing Banks have agreed (in their sole discretion) to release the
Lenders from their participations in such Letters of Credit) and so long as
the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections
2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full
force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination
of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

  

SECTION 9.06. Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to
the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof.

  

SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

  

SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, each Issuing Bank and Lender and each of its Affiliates is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
obligations at any time owing by such Issuing Bank or Lender to or for the
credit or the account of any Borrower or any Account Party against any of and
all the obligations of such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may
be) now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Issuing Bank
or Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Issuing Bank or Lender shall
have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be
unmatured; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall
exercise any such right of set-off, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid
over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17(h) and, pending such payment,
shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed
held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and
(b) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a
statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such
Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of set-off. The rights
of each Issuing Bank and Lender under this Section are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Issuing Bank
or Lender may have. Any Lender or Issuing Bank exercising its rights under
this Section shall give notice thereof to the relevant Borrower and the
relevant Account Party on or prior to the day of the exercise of such rights.

(a)This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the
laws of the State of New York (excluding any principles of conflicts of law or
other rule of law that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York).

  

(b)Each of Holdings, the Borrowers and the Account Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York

extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Term
Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action
or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against
Holdings, a Borrower or an Account Party or any of their respective properties
in the courts of any jurisdiction.

  

(c)Each of Holdings, the Borrowers and the Account Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in
paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

  

(d)Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in
the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement or
any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

  

SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).
EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

SECTION 9.12. Confidentiality.

  

135

  

  

  

* * *

  

  



(a)Each of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders agrees to maintain
the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that
Information may be disclosed, in each case solely in connection with the
Transactions and on a “need to know” basis; (i) to its and its Affiliates’
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal
counsel and other advisors (collectively, “Representatives”) (it being
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed
of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such
Information confidential and the Agents, Issuing Banks and Lenders shall be
responsible for their respective Representative’s compliance with this
paragraph), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over such Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender or its Affiliates, (iii)
to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process; provided, that (A) in the case of this clause (iii) and
the foregoing clause (ii), to the extent permitted by applicable law,
regulation or government order and otherwise practical, and other than to the
extent such request or demand is in the ordinary course of the business of
such Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender or consistent with the regulatory
compliance practices and procedures of such Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender,
Holdings is promptly notified of such proceeding, process, requirement,
request or demand and given a reasonable opportunity, with the cooperation of
the applicable Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender, to seek confidential treatment,
an appropriate protective order, or other remedy, and (B) if disclosure is
nonetheless required pursuant to this clause (iii) or the foregoing clause
(ii), the applicable Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender may disclose only the
portion of information that is required to be disclosed or as is consistent
with the regulatory practices and procedures of such Agent, Issuing Bank or
Lender, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement; provided that such party
has agreed in writing for the benefit of Holdings to keep such information
confidential as provided in this Section 9.12, (v) in connection with the
exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights
hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to a written agreement containing
provisions the same as those of this Section, to (A) any assignee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement or (B) any actual or prospective
counterparty (or its advisors) to any Swap Agreement relating to the Loan
Parties and their Obligations, (vii) with the consent of the Parent Borrower
or (viii) to the extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other
than as a result of a breach of this Section or (B) becomes available to an
Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than Holdings, a Borrower or an Account Party. For the purposes of this
Section, “Information” means all information received from Holdings, any
Borrower, any of their Subsidiaries, or any Account Party relating to
Holdings, any Borrower, any Account Party or their respective business, other
than any such information that is available to any Agent, any Issuing Bank or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Holdings, any
Borrower, any of their Subsidiaries, or any Account Party. Any Person required
to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section
shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such
Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality
of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential
information.

  

(b)Each Lender acknowledges that Information as defined in Section 9.12(a)
furnished to it pursuant to this Agreement may include material non-public
Information concerning the Loan Parties and their securities, and confirms
that it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-
public Information and that it will handle such material non-public
Information in accordance with those procedures, applicable law, including
Federal and state securities laws, and the terms hereof.

  

(c)All information, including waivers and amendments, furnished by the Loan
Parties, their representatives or the Administrative Agent pursuant to, or in
the course of administering, this Agreement will be syndicate-level
information, which may contain material non-public Information about the Loan
Parties and their securities. Accordingly, each Lender represents to Holdings
(on behalf of the

  

136

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Loan Parties) and the Administrative Agent and Term Agent that it has
identified in its Administrative Questionnaire a credit contact who may
receive Information that may contain material non-public Information in
accordance with its compliance procedures, applicable law and the terms
hereof.

  

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other agreement,
(i) each Loan Party agrees that the Information provided regarding the Parent
Borrower and its affiliates and the Transactions may be disseminated by or on
behalf of the Agents and Lead Arrangers to prospective Lenders and other
persons who have agreed to be bound by customary confidentiality undertakings
(including, “click-through” agreements), all in accordance with the such Agent
or Lead Arranger’s standard loan syndication practices (whether transmitted
electronically by means of a website, e-mail or otherwise, or made available
orally or in writing, including at potential lender or other meetings) and
(ii) each Loan Party agrees that the Agents and Lead Arrangers may share with
their respective affiliates on a confidential basis any information relating
to the credit facility under this Agreement, the other Transactions or the
Parent Borrower or its Affiliates and after the public announcement of the
Transactions, may disclose information relating to the credit facility under
this Agreement to Gold Sheets and other publications or for its marketing
materials, with such information to consist of deal terms and other
information customarily found in such publications or marketing materials and
that, after the Closing Date, the Agents and Lead Arrangers may otherwise use
the corporate name and logo of the Parent Borrower and its subsidiaries and
affiliates in “tombstones” or other advertisements, marketing materials or
public statements, provided, that, in the case of any use of the corporate
name and logo in any advertisements for public distribution, such Agent or
Lead Arranger shall have obtained the consent of the Parent Borrower, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under no
circumstance will any Information be disclosed to a Disqualified Lender that
constitutes a Disqualified Lender at the time of such disclosure without the
Parent Borrower’s prior written consent, except as required by law.

  

SECTION 9.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such
Loan under applicable law (collectively the “Charges”), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan
hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and
Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not
payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and
the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or
periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until
such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds
Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such
Lender.

  

SECTION 9.14. USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies each of the Loan
Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Loan Parties, which
information includes the name and address of such Loan Parties and other
information that will allow such Lender to identify such Loan Parties in
accordance with the Patriot Act.

  

SECTION 9.15. No Fiduciary Duty. The Administrative Agent, each Lender and
their respective Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this
paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have economic interests that conflict with
those of the Loan Parties, their stockholders and/or their Affiliates. Each
Loan Party agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be
deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or
other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and such Loan Party,
its stockholders or its Affiliates, on the other. The Loan Parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents
(including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are
arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and
the Loan Parties, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the
process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary
responsibility in favor of any Loan Party, its stockholders or its Affiliates
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of
rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto
(irrespective of whether any

  

137

  

  

  

* * *

  

  

Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Loan Party, its
stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to
any Loan Party except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan
Documents and (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the
agent or fiduciary of any Loan Party, its management, stockholders, creditors
or any other Person. Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that it has
consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed
appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment
with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Loan
Party agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory
services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such
Loan Party, in connection with such transaction or the process leading
thereto.

  

SECTION 9.16. Keepwell. Each Loan Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at
the time the Collateral Agreement or the grant of a security interest under
the Loan Documents, in each case, by any Specified Loan Party becomes
effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally,
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds
or other support to each Specified Loan Party with respect to such Swap
Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Loan Party from time to time to
honor all of its obligations under the Loan Documents in respect of such Swap
Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability
that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor’s
obligations and undertakings under the Collateral Agreement voidable under
applicable Law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and
not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings of each
Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and
effect until the Obligations have been paid and performed in full. Each Loan
Party intends this Section to constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to
constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a “keepwell, support, or
other agreement” for the benefit of, each Specified Loan Party for all
purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

ARTICLE II

Guarantee

SECTION 2.01. Guarantee. Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, jointly
with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely
as a surety, the due and punctual payment and performance of the Obligations.
Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed,
in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it
will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any

  

  

  

  

  

  

3

  

* * *

  

  

extension or renewal of any Obligation. Each of the Guarantors waives
presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Loan Party of any of
the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and
notice of protest for nonpayment.

  

SECTION 2.02. Guarantee of Payment. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that
its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of
collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any security held for the
payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit
on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in favor
of any Borrower, any Account Party or any other Person.

  

SECTION 2.03. No Limitations, Etc. (a) Except for termination of a Guarantor’s
obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 6.15, the obligations
of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation,
impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver,
release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any
defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by
reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or
otherwise, other than the defense of payment of such obligations in accordance
with the terms thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or
otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy
under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any rescission,
waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or
provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with
respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iii) the release of any
security held by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party for the
Obligations or any of them; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or
otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (v) any other act or
omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any
Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of
law or equity (other than the payment in full of all the Loan Document
Obligations (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense
reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim
has been made)). Each Guarantor expressly authorizes the Secured Parties to
take and hold security for the payment and performance of the Obligations, to
exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without
consideration), to enforce or apply such security (in accordance with the Loan
Documents) and direct the order and manner of any sale thereof in their sole
discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or
obligors upon or in respect of the Obligations, in each case in accordance
with the Loan Documents, all without affecting the obligations of any
Guarantor (in its capacity as such) hereunder.

  

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives
any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Loan Party or the
unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the
cessation from any cause of the liability of any Loan Party, other than the
payment in full of all the Loan Document Obligations (other than unasserted
indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection
obligations, in each case for which no claim has been

  

  

  

  

4

  

* * *

  

  

made). The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their
election, and in each case in accordance with the Loan Documents, foreclose on
any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or
nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of
foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other
accommodation with any Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy
available to them against any Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in
any way the liability of any Guarantor (in its capacity as such) hereunder
except to the extent the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full
(other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or
yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made).
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor (in its
capacity as such) waives any defense arising out of any such election even
though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to
extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy
of such Guarantor against any Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security.

  

SECTION 2.04. Reinstatement. Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee
hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be,
if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or
must otherwise be restored to any Loan Party by the Administrative Agent or
any other Secured Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan
Party or otherwise.

  

SECTION 2.05. Agreement To Pay; Subrogation. In furtherance of the foregoing
and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue
hereof, upon the failure of any Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as
the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice
of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will
forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to the applicable Secured Parties in cash the amount of such
unpaid Obligation. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the
Administrative Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against
such Loan Party or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of
right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise
shall in all respects be subject to Article V.

  

SECTION 2.06. Information. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being
and keeping itself informed of each Loan Party’s financial condition and
assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of
the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such
Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the
Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties will have any duty to advise
such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such
circumstances or risks.

  

ARTICLE III

Security Interest

  

SECTION 3.01. Security Interest. (a) As security for the payment or
performance, as the case may be, in full of the Obligations, each Grantor
hereby assigns and pledges to the Administrative Agent, its successors and
assigns, for the ratable benefit of the

  

  

  

5

  

* * *

  

  

Secured Parties, and hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, its successors
and assigns, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a security
interest (the “Security Interest”) in, all of its right, title and interest
in, to and under any and all of the following assets now owned or at any time
hereafter acquired by such Grantor or in, to or under which such Grantor now
has or at any time hereafter may acquire any right, title or interest
(collectively, the “Collateral”):

  

(i)     all Accounts (other than Accounts that are identifiable proceeds of
the sale or other disposition of Term Loan Exclusive Collateral);

  

(ii)     all Deposit Accounts and all cash credited thereto, including,
without limitation, the Concentration Account and the Control Accounts and all
cash credited thereto (other than any Deposit Account that contains solely the
identifiable cash proceeds of property that was Term Loan Exclusive Collateral
when such cash proceeds arose);

  

(iii) all Inventory;

  

(iv) all Payment Intangibles;

  

(v) all books and records pertaining to any and/or all of the Collateral; and

  

(vi) to the extent not otherwise included, all Proceeds and products of any
and all of the foregoing and all supporting obligations given by any Person
with respect to the foregoing.

  

(b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the
security interest granted under this Section 3.01 attach to and the term
“Collateral” shall not include (A) any lease, license, contract or agreement
to which any Grantor is a party (other than contracts between or among
Holdings and its subsidiaries), and any of its rights or interest thereunder,
if and to the extent that a security interest is prohibited by or in violation
of (i) any law, rule or regulation applicable to such Grantor or any asset or
property of any Grantor (with no requirement to obtain the consent of any
Governmental Authority, including without limitation, no requirement to comply
with the Federal Assignment of Claims Act or any similar statute), or (ii) a
term, provision or condition of any such lease, license, contract or agreement
(unless such law, rule, regulation, term, provision or condition would be
rendered ineffective with respect to the creation of the security interest
hereunder pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the New York
UCC (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or
any other applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code) or principles of
equity); provided however that the Collateral shall include (and such security
interest shall attach) immediately at such time as the contractual or legal
prohibition shall no longer be applicable and to the extent severable, shall
attach immediately to any portion of such lease, license, contract or
agreement not subject to the prohibitions specified in (i) or (ii) above;
provided further that the exclusions referred to in clause (A) of this Section
3.01(b) shall not include any Proceeds of any such lease, license, contract or
agreement unless such Proceeds also constitute Excluded Assets; (B) any assets

* * *

  

  

the pledge of or granting a security interest in which would (i) violate any
law, rule or regulation applicable to such Grantor (with no requirement to
obtain the consent of any Governmental Authority) or (ii) require a consent,
approval, or other authorization of a landlord or other third party, in the
case of this subclause (ii) only, if such consent, approval or other
authorization cannot be obtained after the use of commercially reasonable
efforts by the Grantors (provided that there shall be no requirement to obtain
the consent of any Governmental Authority); (C) any Deposit Accounts
specifically and exclusively used (1) for payroll, payroll taxes, workers’
compensation or unemployment compensation, pension benefits and other similar
expenses to or for the benefit of any Grantor’s employees and accrued and
unpaid employee compensation (including salaries, wages, benefits and expense
reimbursements), (2) as zero balance deposit accounts, (3) for trust or
fiduciary purposes in the ordinary course of business and (4) for all taxes
required to be collected or withheld (including, without limitation, federal

owing to any governmental unit thereof, sales, use and excise taxes, customs
duties, import duties and independent customs brokers’ charges) for which any
Grantor may become liable; (D) any other Excluded Accounts (as defined in the
Credit Agreement); (E) any interest of a Grantor in any “Bank Property” (as
defined in that certain Amended and Restated Consumer Credit Card Program
Agreement dated November 5, 2009, by and between J. C. Penney Corporation,
Inc. and GE Money Bank (as in effect on the date hereof, the “GE Agreement”));
and (F) any assets, if in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent
and the Parent Borrower, the burden, cost or consequences of creating or
perfecting such pledges or security interests in such assets shall be
excessive in view of the benefits to be obtained by the Lenders therefrom.

  

(c) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent at any
time and from time to time to file in any relevant jurisdiction any initial
financing statements with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof and
amendments thereto that (i) indicate the Collateral by any description that
reasonably approximates the description of such Collateral contained in this
Agreement and (ii) contain the information required by Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code of each applicable jurisdiction for the filing of any
financing statement or amendment, including whether such Grantor is an
organization, the type of organization and any organizational identification
number issued to such Grantor. Each Grantor agrees to provide such information
to the Administrative Agent promptly upon request.

  

(d) Each Grantor also ratifies its authorization for the Administrative Agent
to file in any relevant jurisdiction any initial financing statements or
amendments thereto if filed prior to the date hereof.

  

(e) The Security Interest is granted as security only and shall not subject
the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to, or in any way alter or
modify, any obligation or liability of any Grantor with respect to or arising
out of the Collateral.

  

SECTION 3.02. Representations and Warranties. The Grantors jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent and the other
Secured Parties that:

  

  

  

  

  

  

7

  

* * *

  

  

  

(a)Each Grantor has good and valid rights in and title to the Collateral with
respect to which it has purported to grant a Security Interest hereunder and
has full power and authority to grant to the Administrative Agent the Security
Interest in such Collateral pursuant hereto and to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
without the consent or approval of any other Person other than any consent or
approval that has been obtained.

  

(b) The Perfection Certificate has been duly prepared, completed and executed
and the information set forth therein, including the exact legal name of each
Grantor, is correct and complete as of the date hereof. The Uniform Commercial
Code financing statements or other appropriate filings, recordings or
registrations containing a description of the Collateral that have been
prepared by the Administrative Agent based upon the information provided to
the Administrative Agent in the Perfection Certificate for filing in each
governmental, municipal or other office specified in Schedule 6 to the
Perfection Certificate, as modified, delivered, prepared or supplemented from
time to time pursuant to the Credit Agreement (or specified by notice from the
Parent Borrower to the Administrative Agent after the date hereof in the case
of filings, recordings or registrations required by Section 5.03(a), 5.11 or
5.12 of the Credit Agreement), are all the filings, recordings and
registrations that are necessary to establish a legal, valid and perfected
security interest in favor of the Administrative Agent (for the ratable
benefit of the Secured Parties) in respect of all Collateral in which the
Security Interest may be perfected by filing, recording or registration in the
United States (or any political subdivision thereof) and, to the extent
applicable, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and no further or subsequent
filing, refiling, recording, rerecording, registration or reregistration is
necessary in any such jurisdiction, except as provided under applicable law
with respect to the filing of continuation statements.

  

(c)The Security Interest constitutes (i) a legal and valid security interest
in all the Collateral securing the payment and performance of the Obligations
and (ii) subject to the filings described in Section 3.02(b), a perfected
security interest in all Collateral in which a security interest may be
perfected by filing, recording or registering a financing statement or
analogous document in the United States (or any political subdivision thereof)
and, to the extent applicable, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico pursuant to the
Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law in the United States (or any
political subdivision thereof) and, to the extent applicable, the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico. The Security Interest is and shall be prior to any other Lien
on any of the Collateral, other than Permitted Encumbrances that have priority
as a matter of law and Liens expressly permitted pursuant to clauses (c) and
(h) of Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement.

  

(d) The Collateral is owned by the Grantors free and clear of any Lien, other
than involuntary Permitted Encumbrances, Specified Involuntary Liens securing
obligations not in excess of $20,000,000 at any time and Liens expressly
permitted pursuant to clauses (a), (c), (g), (h) and (m) of Section 6.02 of
the Credit Agreement. None of the Grantors has filed or consented to the
filing of (i) any financing statement or analogous document under the Uniform
Commercial Code or any other applicable laws covering any Collateral except
any such filings made pursuant to the GE Agreement, or (ii) any assignment in
which any Grantor assigns any Collateral or any security agreement or similar

instrument covering any Collateral with any foreign governmental, municipal or
other office, which financing statement or analogous document, assignment,
security agreement or similar instrument is still in effect, except, in each
case, for involuntary Permitted Encumbrances, Specified Involuntary Liens
securing obligations not in excess of $20,000,000 at any time and Liens
expressly permitted pursuant to clauses (a), (c), (g), (h) and (m) of Section
6.02 of the Credit Agreement.

  

(e)To the knowledge of each Grantor, (i) each Grantor owns, licenses or
otherwise has the rights to use, all Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights or other
Intellectual Property material to the preparing for sale or sale of the
Inventory, (ii) the use thereof by each Grantor for any such purpose does not
infringe upon the rights of any other Person and (iii) no such Intellectual
Property (other than Intellectual Property rights granted to such Grantor
under license agreements with third parties) is subject to any Lien or other
restriction (other than (A) any such Lien or other restriction with respect to
which a waiver or release has been obtained or (B) any such Lien or
restriction permitted under the Credit Agreement), in each case except to the
extent (1) of any defects in ownership or licenses and any such infringements
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse
Effect or (2) that the failure to have such rights, such infringement or such
Lien or restriction would not materially adversely affect the exercise of the
Administrative Agent’s rights with respect to such Intellectual Property to
prepare for sale or to sell any Inventory under Article IV.

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties set
forth in this Section as to perfection and priority of the Security Interest
in Proceeds are limited to the extent provided in Section 9-315 of the Uniform
Commercial Code.

  

SECTION 3.03. Covenants. (a) Each Grantor agrees to maintain, at its own cost
and expense, such complete and accurate records with respect to the Collateral
owned by it as is in accordance with such prudent and standard practices used
in industries that are the same as or similar to those in which such Grantor
is engaged, but in any event to include accounting records indicating all
payments and proceeds received with respect to any part of the Collateral,
and, at such time or times as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request,
promptly to prepare and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly certified
schedule or schedules in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent showing the identity, amount and location of any and all
Inventory.

  

(b) (i) Each Grantor shall, at its own expense, take any and all commercially
reasonable actions to defend title to the Collateral against all Persons and
to defend the Security Interest of the Administrative Agent in the Collateral
and the priority thereof against any Lien other than involuntary Permitted
Encumbrances, Specified Involuntary Liens securing obligations not in excess
of $20,000,000 at any time and Liens expressly permitted by clauses (a), (c),
(g), (h) and (m) of Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement (and, in the case of
the priority of the Security Interest of the Administrative Agent, other than
Permitted Encumbrances that have priority as a matter of law, Specified
Involuntary Liens securing obligations not in excess of $20,000,000 at any
time and those Liens expressly permitted pursuant to clauses (c) and (h) of
Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement).

  

  

  

  

9

  

* * *

  

  

  

(ii) Each Grantor shall, at its own expense, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each bill of lading (or similar electronic document referring
to the goods represented by such bill of lading) to bear the following legend:

  

THE GOODS REFERENCED IN THIS [BILL OF LADING] ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIEN OF WELLS
FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

  

(c) Each Grantor agrees, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver
and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and take
all such actions as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably
request to better assure, preserve, protect and perfect the Security Interest
and the rights and remedies created hereby, including paying any fees and
taxes required in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the granting of the Security Interest and the filing of any
financing statements or other documents in connection herewith or therewith.
Without limiting the foregoing, at any time there is a Cash Dominion Period,
upon the request of Administrative Agent, each Grantor shall promptly give a
written notice to the credit card processors used by such Grantor of the
arrangements under the Credit Agreement (provided, that, foregoing shall not
be construed to include the arrangements under the GE Agreement), providing
for the payment of the amounts owing from such processor to a Control Account,
limiting the right to change where payments are made without the approval of
Administrative Agent and with such other terms and conditions as
Administrative Agent may reasonably require.

  

(d) At its option, the Administrative Agent may discharge past due taxes,
assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances at
any time levied or placed on the Collateral and not permitted pursuant to
Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement or this Agreement, and may pay for the
maintenance and preservation of the Collateral to the extent any Grantor fails
to do so as required by the Credit Agreement or this Agreement, and each
Grantor jointly and severally agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent on
demand for any payment made or any expense incurred by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization; provided that nothing in this
paragraph shall be interpreted as excusing any Grantor from the performance
of, or imposing any obligation on the Administrative Agent or any Secured
Party to cure or perform, any covenants or other promises of any Grantor with
respect to taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or
other encumbrances and maintenance as set forth herein or in the other Loan
Documents. The Administrative Agent will give notice to the Parent Borrower of
any exercise of the Administrative Agent’s rights or powers pursuant to this
paragraph (d); provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such
notice shall not operate as a waiver of, or preclude any other or further
exercise of, such rights or powers or the exercise of any other right or power
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(e) Each Grantor shall remain liable to observe and perform all the conditions
and obligations to be observed and performed by it under each contract,
agreement or instrument relating to the Collateral, all in accordance with the
terms and conditions thereof, to the same extent as if the Security Interest
had not been granted to the

  

  

  

  

10

  

* * *

  

  

Administrative Agent in the Collateral, and each Grantor jointly and severally
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and the Secured
Parties from and against any and all liability for such performance.

  

(f) None of the Grantors shall (i) make or permit to be made a pledge or
hypothecation of the Collateral or (ii) grant any other Lien in respect of the
Collateral, except as expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement. None of the
Grantors shall make or permit to be made any transfer of the Collateral,
except that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Grantors that an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and
that during the continuance thereof the Grantors shall not sell, convey,
lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Collateral (which notice
may be given by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing), the Grantors may
use and dispose of the Collateral in any lawful manner not inconsistent with
the provisions of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

  

(g) The Grantors, at their own expense, shall maintain or cause to be
maintained insurance covering physical loss or damage to the Collateral in
accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 5.07 of the Credit
Agreement. Each Grantor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the
Administrative Agent (and all officers, employees or agents designated by the
Administrative Agent) as such Grantor’s true and lawful agent (and attorney-
in-fact) for the purpose, during the continuance of an Event of Default, of
(i) making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of Collateral under
policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such Grantor on any check, draft,
instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of
insurance and (ii) making all determinations and decisions with respect
thereto. In the event that any Grantor at any time or times shall fail to
obtain or maintain any of the policies of insurance required hereby or to pay
any premium in whole or part relating thereto, the Administrative Agent may,
without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of the Grantors
hereunder or any Event of Default, in its sole discretion, obtain and maintain
such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take any other actions
with respect thereto as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems advisable.
All sums disbursed by the Administrative Agent in connection with this
paragraph, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, expenses and
other charges relating thereto, shall be payable, upon demand, by the Grantors
to the Administrative Agent and shall be additional Obligations secured
hereby.

  

(h) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
none of the Grantors will, without the Administrative Agent’s prior written
consent (which shall be deemed given if the Administrative Agent has not
responded within 5 Business Days of a written request therefor), grant any
extension of the time of payment of any Accounts or Payment Intangibles
included in the Collateral, compromise, compound or settle the same for less
than the full amount thereof, release, wholly or partly, any Person liable for
the payment thereof or allow any credit or discount whatsoever thereon, other
than extensions, compromises, settlements, releases, credits or discounts
granted or made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with its
current practices and in accordance with such prudent and standard practice
used in industries that are the same as or similar to those in which such
Grantor is engaged.

  

  

  

  

11

  

* * *

  

  

  

  

(i) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
each of the Grantors will collect and enforce, in accordance with past
practices and in the ordinary course of business, all amounts due to such
Grantor under the Accounts and Payment Intangibles owned by it. Such Grantor
will deliver to the Administrative Agent promptly upon its reasonable request
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
duplicate invoices with respect to each Account and, to the extent applicable,
each Payment Intangible owned by it, bearing such language of assignment as
the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify in connection with its
exercise of remedies hereunder.

  

(j) Administrative Agent agrees that, except during the occurrence and
continuance of an Event of Default, it shall not (i) issue any instructions
(including, but not limited to, any directions in writing) to any customs
broker, freight forwarder or carrier party thereto (“Freight Forwarder”) under
any customs broker agreement or otherwise, nor shall it (ii) terminate or
change its consent to any Freight Forwarder continuing to release Collateral
pursuant to any instructions given to Freight Forwarder by the applicable
Grantor or such Grantor’s authorized agents. For the avoidance of doubt, so
long as (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii)
Administrative Agent does not otherwise direct in writing to the applicable
Grantor and Freight Forwarder, Grantors may permit the sellers of inventory
(or any freight forwarder or other persons involved in the importing of any
Collateral into the United States) to deliver the original documents
(including, without limitation, bills of lading or cargo receipts) issued with
respect to Collateral (collectively, the “Import Documents”) to any Freight
Forwarder, with copies of such Import Documents, and any other document or
instruction which may be appropriate, to the applicable Grantor and
Administrative Agent.

  

ARTICLE IV

Remedies

  

SECTION 4.01. Remedies upon Default. Each Grantor agrees that (a) upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and upon the
demand of the Administrative Agent, it will make the Collateral available to
the Administrative Agent, and it is agreed that the Administrative Agent shall
have the right, to the extent permitted by applicable law, with or without
legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to
take possession of the Collateral and without liability for trespass to enter
any premises where the Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking
possession of or removing the Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and
all rights afforded to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code or
other applicable law and (b) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
a Specified Event of Default and at the other times provided for in the Credit
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to institute a Cash
Dominion Period to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the
Administrative Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory
requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any
part of the Collateral at a public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or
for future delivery as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate. Upon
consummation of any such sale the Administrative Agent shall

  

12

  

* * *

  

  

have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers
thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any sale of the
Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or
right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the
extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which
such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of
law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.

  

The Administrative Agent shall give the applicable Grantors 10 days’ written
notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of
Section 9-612 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of
the Administrative Agent’s intention to make any sale of Collateral. Such
notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such
sale. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary
business hours and at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix
and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the
Collateral, or any portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an
entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole
and absolute discretion) determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be
obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do
so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have
been given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication,
adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time
to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale
may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same
was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is
made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained
by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or
purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability
in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the
Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be
sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by
law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid
for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of
redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said
rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law),
the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may (with the consent
of the Administrative Agent) make payment on account thereof by using any
Obligation then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a
credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance
with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without
further accountability to any Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written
agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated
as a sale thereof; the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such
sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return
of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the
fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an
agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations
paid in full, in which case any excess proceeds thereof shall be disposed of
as set forth in Section 4.02 hereof. As an alternative to exercising the power
of sale herein conferred upon it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a
suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the
Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court
or courts having competent jurisdiction or

  

  

  

  

13

  

* * *

  

  

pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 4.01 shall be deemed to conform to the
commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New
York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.

  

SECTION 4.02. Application of Proceeds. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall apply the
proceeds of any collection or sale of Collateral, including any Collateral
consisting of cash, as specified in Section 2.17(h) of the Credit Agreement.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Administrative Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of
application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this
Agreement and the Credit Agreement. Upon any sale of Collateral by the
Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute
or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or of
the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser
or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall
not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money
paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any
way for the misapplication thereof.

  

SECTION 4.03. Grantor’s Obligations Upon Default. Upon the request of the
Administrative Agent after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, each Grantor will:

  

(a)assemble and make available to the Administrative Agent all books and
records relating to the Collateral at any place or places reasonably specified
by the Administrative Agent, whether at a Grantor’s premises or elsewhere;

  

(b) permit the Administrative Agent, by the Administrative Agent’s
representatives and agents, to enter any premises where all or any part of the
Collateral, or the books and records relating thereto, or both, are located,
to take possession of and/or remove all or any part of the Collateral or to
make copies of the books and records relating thereto, or both, and to conduct
sales of the Collateral, in accordance with the terms hereof, any applicable
Collateral Access Agreements and applicable law, without any obligation to pay
the Grantor for such use and occupancy;

  

(c)at its own expense, cause the independent certified public accountants then
engaged by each Grantor to prepare and deliver to the Administrative Agent, at
any time, and from time to time, promptly upon the Administrative Agent’s
request, the following reports with respect to the Accounts and Payment
Intangibles of the applicable Grantor: (i) a reconciliation of all Accounts
and Payment Intangibles; (ii) an aging of all Accounts and Payment
Intangibles; (iii) trial balances; and (iv) a test verification of such
Accounts and Payment Intangibles.

  

SECTION 4.04. Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property. Solely for the
purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent to exercise rights and remedies
under this Agreement during the continuance of an Event of Default with
respect to Collateral consisting of Inventory, each Grantor hereby (a) grants
to the Administrative Agent a nonexclusive license (exercisable without
payment of royalty or other compensation to the

  

  

14

  

* * *

  

  

Grantor) to use, license or sublicense during the continuance of an Event of
Default any Intellectual Property rights now owned or hereafter acquired by
such Grantor, including in such license reasonable access to all media in
which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer
software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof, solely for
the purposes of preparing for sale and selling (including by affixing
Trademarks owned by or licensed to such Grantor to) any of such Grantor’s
Inventory directly to any Person (in the case of Intellectual Property
licensed to such Grantor by a third party, to the extent permitted under the
Intellectual Property licenses granting such Grantor rights in such
Intellectual Property), which license shall be irrevocable prior to the
Termination Point (as defined below) and (b) agrees that, subject to the
foregoing and in connection therewith, during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Administrative Agent may sell Inventory which bears any Trademark
owned by or licensed to such Grantor (to the extent permitted under the
Intellectual Property licenses granting such Grantor rights in such Trademark)
and any Inventory that is covered by any Copyright owned by or licensed to
such Grantor (to the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property licenses
granting such Grantor rights in such Copyright), and the Administrative Agent
may affix any appropriate Trademark owned by or licensed to such Grantor (to
the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property license granting such
Grantor rights in such Trademark) and sell such Inventory as provided herein;
provided in each case that (i) such license shall be subject to the rights of
any licensee under a license permitted by the last proviso of Section 6.05 of
the Credit Agreement or by Section 6.02(b) of the Credit Agreement, in each
case granted while no Event of Default was continuing, or under any licenses
existing as of the date hereof, (ii) in connection with any such sale of
Inventory or otherwise, such licensed or sublicensed Trademarks shall only be
used in association with goods or services of a quality and nature consistent
with the quality and reputation with which such Trademarks were associated
when used by such Grantor prior to the exercise of the license rights set
forth herein, and (iii) no license shall be granted under this Section 4.04 to
the extent that such grant would violate or constitute a default under any
agreement to which any Grantor is a party. Such license and rights to use such
Intellectual Property of any Grantor shall terminate automatically without
notice or other action, when all the Loan Document Obligations have been paid
in full (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense
reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim
has been made) and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend under the
Credit Agreement, the LC Exposure has been reduced to zero and no Issuing Bank
has any further obligations to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit
Agreement (the “Termination Point”). The use of such license by the
Administrative Agent may only be exercised upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, provided that any license, sublicense or
other transaction entered into by the Administrative Agent in accordance
herewith shall be binding upon the Grantors notwithstanding any subsequent
cure of an Event of Default.

  

ARTICLE V

Indemnity, Subrogation and Subordination

  

SECTION 5.01. Indemnity and Subrogation. In addition to all such rights of
indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but
subject to Section 5.03), each of the Borrowers and each of the Account
Parties agrees that (a) in the event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor
under this Agreement in respect of any

  

  

15

  

* * *

  

  

Obligation of a Borrower or an Account Party, such Borrower or such Account
Party (as the case may be) shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount
of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the
Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment
and (b) in the event any assets of any Grantor shall be sold pursuant to this
Agreement to satisfy in whole or in part an Obligation of a Borrower or an
Account Party, such Borrower or Account Party (as the case may be) shall
indemnify such Grantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or
the fair market value of the assets so sold.

  

SECTION 5.02. Contribution and Subrogation. Each Guarantor and Grantor (a
“Contributing Party”) agrees (subject to Section 5.03) that, in the event a
payment shall be made by any other Guarantor hereunder in respect of any
Obligation or assets of any other Grantor (other than Holdings or the Parent
Borrower) shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy any Obligation
of a Borrower or an Account Party and such other Guarantor or Grantor (the
“Claiming Party”) shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers or
the Account Parties as provided in Section 5.01, the Contributing Party shall
indemnify the Claiming Party in an amount equal to the amount of such payment
or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as
the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator
shall be the net worth of the Contributing Party on the date hereof and the
denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors and
Grantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor or Grantor
becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 6.16 or Section 6.17,
respectively, the date of the supplement hereto executed and delivered by such
Guarantor or Grantor). Any Contributing Party making any payment to a Claiming
Party pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall (subject to Section 5.03) be
subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under Section 5.01 to the
extent of such payment.

  

SECTION 5.03. Subordination. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors and Grantors under
Sections 5.01 and 5.02 and all other rights of the Guarantors and Grantors of
indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall
be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the
Obligations. No failure on the part of any Borrower, any Account Party or any
Guarantor or Grantor to make the payments required by Sections 5.01 and 5.02
(or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in
any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor or Grantor
with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor and Grantor
shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor
or Grantor hereunder.

  

(b) Each of the Guarantors and Grantors hereby agrees that all Indebtedness
and other monetary obligations owed by it to, or to it by, any other
Guarantor, Grantor or any other Subsidiary shall be fully subordinated to the
payment in full in cash of the Obligations.

hereunder to any Subsidiary Party shall be given to it in care of the Parent
Borrower as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.

  

SECTION 6.02. Rights Absolute. All rights of the Administrative Agent
hereunder, the Security Interest and all obligations of each Guarantor and
Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any
lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan
Document (other than this Agreement), any other agreement with respect to any
of the Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the
foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in
any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or
waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement, any other

or non-perfection of any Lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment
or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guarantee, securing or
guaranteeing all or any of the Obligations, or (d) any other circumstance that
might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any
Guarantor or Grantor in respect of the Obligations or this Agreement, other
than payment in full of the Loan Document Obligations (other than unasserted
indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection
obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made). No breach by any
Grantor of any limitation with respect to Swap Obligations or Swap Agreements,
including without limitation the limitations of Section 6.01(m) of the Credit
Agreement, shall affect any lien granted with respect to such Swap Obligation
or Swap Agreement pursuant to any Security Document.

  

SECTION 6.03. Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents
and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in
connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders and shall survive the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and
issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any
Lender or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any
other Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge
of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit
is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and
effect until terminated as provided in Section 6.15(a).

  

SECTION 6.04. Binding Effect; Several Agreement. This Agreement shall become
effective as to any Party when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such
Party shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart
hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and
thereafter shall be binding upon such Party and the Administrative Agent and
their respective permitted successors and

  

  

  

17

  

* * *

  

  

assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Party, the Administrative
Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and
assigns, except that no Party shall have the right to assign or transfer its
rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein or in the Collateral
(and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall
be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Party and may be
amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Party
without the approval of any other Party and without affecting the obligations
of any other Party hereunder.

  

SECTION 6.05. Successors and Assigns. Whenever in this Agreement any of the
parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the
permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises

SECTION 6.07. Administrative Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Each Guarantor
and Grantor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent the attorney-in-fact of
such Guarantor or Grantor during the continuance of an Event of Default for
the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any
action and executing any instrument that the Administrative Agent may
reasonably deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof,
which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have
the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, with full power of substitution either in the Administrative Agent’s
name or in the name of such Guarantor or Grantor (a) to receive, endorse,
assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money
orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part
thereof; (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give
discharges and releases of all or any of the Collateral; (c) to sign the name
of any Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the
Collateral; (d) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or
proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to
collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any
rights in respect of any Collateral; (e) to settle, compromise, compound,
adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of
the Collateral; and (f) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any
agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral,
and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent
were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes; provided that
nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the
Administrative Agent to make any commitment or to present or file any claim or
notice, or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part
thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property
covered thereby, other than to exercise commercially reasonable care in the

and preservation of any Collateral in its possession. The Administrative Agent
and the Parent Borrower acknowledge that the exercise of the powers granted to
the Administrative Agent herein to deal with or dispose of the Collateral on a
basis in keeping with orderly business proceedings designed to preserve the
value of the Collateral to customers of the Grantor would be commercially
reasonable.

  

SECTION 6.08. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of the State of New York (excluding any
principles of conflicts of law or other rule of law that would cause the
application of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York).

  

SECTION 6.09. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent, any other Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the other Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted
by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any other Agent, any
Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at
the time. No notice or demand on any Party in any case shall entitle any Party
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

  

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or
modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by the Administrative Agent and the Parties with respect to which such waiver,
amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in
accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement.

  

SECTION 6.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO (INCLUDING, FOR THE
AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT) HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY
HERETO (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT) (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS

  

  

  

  

19

  

* * *

  

  

REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION.

  

SECTION 6.11. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

  

SECTION 6.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which
shall constitute a single contract (subject to Section 6.04), and shall become
effective as provided in Section 6.04. Delivery of an executed signature page
to this Agreement by telecopy or electronic transmission shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 6.13. Headings. Article and Section headings used herein are for the
purpose of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and are not to
affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting,
this Agreement.

  

SECTION 6.14. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) Each of the
parties hereto (including, for avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent)
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property,
to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York
sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the
Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of
any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York
State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the
parties hereto (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative
Agent) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any other
Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action
or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against
any Guarantor or Grantor or its respective properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto (including, for avoidance of doubt, the
Administrative Agent) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

20

  

* * *

  

  

laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in
paragraph (a) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent) hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

  

(c) Each party to this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Administrative Agent) irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 6.01. Nothing in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

  

SECTION 6.15. Termination or Release. (a) This Agreement, the Guarantees made
herein, the Security Interest and all other security interests granted hereby
shall automatically terminate when all the Loan Document Obligations have been
paid in full (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense
reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim
has been made) and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend under the
Credit Agreement, the LC Exposure has been reduced to zero and no Issuing Bank
has any further obligations to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit
Agreement.

  

(b) A Subsidiary Party shall automatically be released from its obligations
hereunder and, in the case of a Subsidiary Party that is a Subsidiary Grantor,
the Security Interest in the Collateral of such Subsidiary Grantor shall be
automatically released upon the consummation of any transaction not prohibited
by the Credit Agreement as a result of which such Subsidiary Party ceases to
be a Subsidiary of Holdings.

  

(c) Upon any sale or other transfer by any Grantor of any Collateral that is
not prohibited by the Credit Agreement to any Person that is not a Grantor, or
upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the Security
Interest granted hereby in any Collateral pursuant to Section 9.02 of the
Credit Agreement, the Security Interest in such Collateral shall be
automatically released.

  

(d) In connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraph (a),
(b) or (c) above, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to any
Grantor at such Grantor’s expense, all documents that such Grantor shall
reasonably request to evidence such termination or release and shall authorize
the filing of any applicable documents evidencing such termination or release
(including, without limitation, UCC termination statements). Any execution and
delivery of documents pursuant to this Section 6.15 shall be without recourse
to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.

  

SECTION 6.16. Additional Guarantors. (a) Pursuant to, and to the extent
provided in, Section 5.11 of the Credit Agreement, additional Subsidiaries may
be required to enter into this Agreement as Guarantors. Upon execution and
delivery by the Administrative Agent and any such Subsidiary of an instrument
in the form of Exhibit A

  

  

  

  

  

21

  

* * *

  

  

hereto, such Subsidiary shall become a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder with the
same force and effect as if originally named as a Subsidiary Guarantor herein.

  

(b) The execution and delivery of any such instrument described in paragraph
(a) above shall not require the consent of any other party hereto. The rights
and obligations of each party hereunder shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the addition of any new Guarantee Party as a party to this
Agreement.

  

SECTION 6.17. Additional Grantors. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit
Agreement, Additional Grantors may enter into this Agreement as Subsidiary
Grantors. Upon execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent and any such
Additional Grantor of an instrument in the form of Exhibit B hereto, such

permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
obligations at any time owing by such Issuing Bank or Lender to or for the
credit or the account of any Guarantor against any of and all the obligations
of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement owed to such
Issuing Bank or Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Issuing Bank or
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured; provided that in the event that any Defaulting
Lender shall exercise any such right of set-off, (x) all amounts so set off
shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further
application in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02 and, pending
such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other
funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the
Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the
Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such
right of set-off. The rights of each Issuing Bank and Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights
of setoff) which such Issuing Bank or Lender may have. Any Lender or Issuing
Bank exercising its rights under this Section shall give notice thereof to the
relevant Guarantor on or prior to the day of the exercise of such rights.

Letters of Credit and as consideration for Loans previously made and Letters

Accordingly, the Administrative Agent and the New Subsidiary agree as follows:
